The life stories of the 12 experts are recorded in the book Missile Life, which was first released by the Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) at the Space Day on Sunday.The 12 commanders and designers have been responsible for China's first-generation surface-to-air missiles, HQ-1, HQ-2, JL-1, HQ-7 and HHQ-7, as well as China's third-generation air defense weapon system.Many of them have made outstanding contributions to several areas of military science, especially missiles in various generations.Qian Wenji, chief designer of China's first generation of surface-to-air missiles, served as chief designer of the "543" surface-to-air missile weapon system, HQ-1 and HQ-2, making important contributions to the development of China's communication electronic and missile technology, and computer application.Chen Huaijin, the chief designer of HQ-2 surface-to-air missile, participated in the establishment of China's first radar force and made outstanding contributions in the field of aircraft guidance, automation and simulation.Chen Guoxin, the chief designer of HHQ-7 surface-to-air missile and the new field weapon system, pioneered in the field of the shipborne ultra-low altitude missiles in the history of China's air defense development.In the development and application of space engineering, China's space program has formed a system of "two chiefs" represented by the chief commander and the chief designer. It can be said that the 12 experts represent the highest level of China's missile development.Their lives and fascinating accounts of their upbringing and professional development of the systems for which they are known, have been published for the first time.The Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, which released these little-known stories, was founded on November 16, 1957. it is China's largest research and development unit of air and space defense and is considered the cradle of China's missile industry.
