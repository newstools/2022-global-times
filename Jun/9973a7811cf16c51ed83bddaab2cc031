Indeed, this is a draft agreement and in this draft there remain some issues that members have not agreed to yet," acknowledged Colombian Ambassador Santiago Wills, who chairs the WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations.But he said months of intense negotiations had made it possible to present "a clean solution" to some issues that had long "appeared intractable."The WTO takes decisions by consensus, making agreements all the harder to reach.Global fisheries subsidies are estimated at between $14 billion and $54 billion a year, according to the body.It is widely agreed that action is needed to protect a crucial resource that millions of people around the world depend on for their livelihoods.WTO members have for the past 20 years been discussing the need for a deal banning subsidies that contribute to illegal and unregulated fishing, as well as to overfishing.Wills noted "significant progress" on the tricky issue of "territoriality," with the draft text ensuring that a WTO panel of experts would not be called upon to decide who has jurisdiction over disputed or overlapping territorial claims.Progress had also been made on the issue of fuel subsidies, and on the so-called special and differential treatment  for developing countries, long a key stumbling block, he said, hailing a "considerable narrowing of differences."Special treatment for the poorest countries is widely accepted but demands from some self-identified developing countries for exemption from subsidy constraints, including large fishing nations like India, have been difficult to swallow for some.AFP
