A man passes by the Central Bank of Argentina in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Aug. 4, 2020. The Argentine government confirmed on Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with its three main groups of private creditors and other minority bondholders to restructure a part of the country's foreign debt, valued at 66.2 billion U.S. dollars.

All eyes now will be on Guzman's replacement.Guzman, 39, said "there should be a political agreement within the governing coalition" to choose his successor.The president's office said that it did not yet know when a replacement for Guzman would be announced. Fernandez had summoned members of his Cabinet and allies to an emergency meeting, one government source said."The president deeply regrets the decision but respects it. He is analyzing his next decisions," said another government source with knowledge of the matter.Reuters
