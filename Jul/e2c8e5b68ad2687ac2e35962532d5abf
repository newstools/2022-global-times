A video celebrating August 1, the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, released by China Central Television on July 30, 2022, displays the live-fire launch of a missile from a transporter erector launcher on a highway in a desert. The missile resembles the DF-17 hypersonic missile, which is publicly displayed at the National Day military parade on October 1, 2019 in Beijing.

Making their debut in the general public for the first time, DF-17 missiles join the National Day parade held in Beijing on October 1, 2019.

After launch, since the DF-17 uses a hypersonic glider as its warhead, which flies faster than Mach 5 with an unpredictable trajectory, it is almost impossible to intercept for contemporary missile defense systems, they said.The DF-17 will play a vital role in safeguarding China's territorial integrity, as regions including the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and Northeast Asia are all within its striking range, Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert, told the Global Times when the missile made its debut in 2019.In addition to stationary targets, the DF-17 can likely also hit slowly moving targets, Song said, referring to aircraft carriers.With Pelosi's possible visit to the island of Taiwan on the horizon, tension in the Taiwan Straits has been rising. The PLA, in showing its capabilities, is telling the US that if it insists on provocation, the PLA will take every manner of countermeasures, Song said.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the PLA is unequivocal on this question that it can fight and win, Song said.
