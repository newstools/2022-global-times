"I can proudly tell everyone, that the J-20 with Chinese engines has it all, both from the inside and outside." It was important to test the engine's performance under different environments across the country, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In high altitude plateau regions, the takeoff of the aircraft could be a problem because it requires high power from the engine, but plateaus have thin air; near the sea, high humidity could cause corrosion, Fu explained.The tests proved that the domestically developed engine can satisfy the operating requirements under all environments across the country, allowing the J-20 to enhance its comprehensive combat capabilities, Fu said.The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force displayed J-20s equipped with domestically developed engines at Airshow China 2021, and analysts said the aircraft's production has accelerated thanks to the new engines."As an aircraft designer, I firmly believe that we can meet all of the PLA's requirements," Gong said.He added that after the J-20, he is developing new types of aviation weapons and equipment, but without elaborating.
