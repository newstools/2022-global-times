Prices for secondhand homes increased 0.1 percent in January from December, with Beijing and Shanghai rising 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, official data showed in February."As the Government Work Report pointed out, China will uphold the principle of 'houses are for living in, not speculation' and will unswervingly promote a mechanism to foster the long-term development of the real estate industry, while maintaining stability in market expectations, as well as land and property prices," said the NBS official."We believe that the stable development of the real estate market still has a foundation and appropriate conditions," Fu stressed.Although local governments have taken favorable moves since February, the investment confidence of real estate companies has not yet fully recovered, analysts said."Property investment growth of less than 5 percent actually signals a contraction, indicating that the willingness of real estate companies to develop and invest is weak, and they have also encountered some resistance and confusion," Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Funds in place for real estate developers fell by 17.7 percent, according to the NBS data.Yan noted that the current policies, which would reduce businesses' financial burdens, have yet to be fully transmitted, adding the most important thing is to boost property sales instead of relying solely on various external financing.From this month going forward, it will become mainstream to actively create a better property environment, encourage real estate companies to acquire land, and eliminate work slack for the whole industry, according to Yan.
