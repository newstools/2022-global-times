It was built with equal footing on both sides, with the two companies jointly investing and developing, as well as sharing risks, profits and markets, the Global Times learned from AVIC on Tuesday.The development of the Z-15 explored a new path in the international cooperation for civilian-use helicopter, as China obtained several key technological breakthroughs in helicopter development, established a new management system for the development of medium-sized helicopters, and filled in a vacuum that previously existed in the country's emergency rescue aviation equipment, AVIC said.
