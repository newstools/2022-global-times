A total of 5.29 million new urban jobs were created in the first five months of the year, official data showed.In May, the surveyed urban unemployment rate among those aged 25-59, the majority of the labor market, came in at 5.1 percent. However, the jobless rate among those aged 16-24, a group that includes new college graduates, hit a record high of 18.4 percent.Global Times
