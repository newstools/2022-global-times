Four people were treated for minor injuries, police said.And in southern Alberta province, truckers continued to block a major border crossing to the US state of Montana.At an emergency meeting late Saturday, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly requested "an additional surge of resources" to bring an end to what police board chair Diane Deans described as a "siege" of the capital."This group is a threat to our democracy," Deans said. "What we're seeing is bigger than just a city of Ottawa problem, this is a nationwide insurrection. This is madness."With public anger rising - thousands of residents have complained of harassment by protesters, and an online petition demanding action has drawn 40,000 signatures - Sloly has faced increased pressure to end what he has called an "unlawful" occupation of the city.Reached for comment by AFP, protest coordinator Jim Torma said the protesters would not back down."They're not going to hide us," Torma said. "We're going to be in [politicians'] faces as long as it takes" to force an end to public health restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.AFP
