In traditional Chinese culture, there is a saying - "all things have a beginning, but few can reach the end."It comes from The Book of Songs, China's first anthology of poems dating back more than 2,000 years. The expression was initially a criticism of King Zhouli from the Western Zhou Dynasty (1046BC-771BC), a notorious tyrant in Chinese history. He was criticized for constantly changing his decree, bringing misery to the people.Making a good start is not difficult, but it is the perseverance to the very end that is hard. The saying later became a motto, which was often inscribed on plates or bottles by ancient Chinese people, to remind them to finish what they start.From a wasteland to a sea of forests, the miraculous transformation of Saihanba, the world's largest man-made plantation in North China's Hebei Province, has manifested such traditional Chinese philosophy advocating perseverance.Since the establishment of the forest farm in 1962, generations of workers have weathered tough conditions there, creating and safeguarding the spectacular different shades of green on the former wasteland.In the first two years, more than 2,000 mu (133.33 hectares) of trees were planted, but only less than 8 percent survived each year due to the severe climate. Thanks to consistent efforts of generations of Saihanba foresters over the past decades, the forest farm has been expanded to 1.15 million mu, becoming an important ecological shield for Beijing and adjacent regions.
