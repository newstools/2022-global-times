It also earned him an Oscar for best original screenplay.He followed that up with another hit, Us, securing a reputation as one of Hollywood's most daring directors.Such was Universal Pictures' confidence in Peele's latest project, it took the unprecedented step of opening a permanent new Nope attraction at its Universal Studios theme park on the same day the movie opens."This is the first time that we've ever opened an attraction day-and-date with a new film," said Universal creative head Jon Corfino."It's the first time I've ever heard of that happening."The actual movie set of Jupiter's Claim - a fictional small Western-themed amusement park which features prominently in Nope - was carefully deconstructed when filming ended at the movie's California desert shooting location, and meticulously rebuilt in the real-world Los Angeles theme park."This whole set was the actual authentic set that was used in the production," said Corfino."It was actually broken apart and brought back here put together... it's basically exactly his vision."Appropriately for the movie's themes, visitors who pay for the VIP studio tour have the opportunity to wander around its fake but hyper-realistic streets, snapping selfies and shooting TikTok videos in front of the saloon, sheriff's office and gold panning mill.It becomes the latest permanent attraction on Universal's studio tour, where tourists are ferried around soundstages and sets from classic movies such as Steven Spielberg's Jaws and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho."Jordan Peele takes his place among that lineage," said Corfino.Whether the film does so remains to be seen - early reviews have been mixed, with Empire praising an "ambitious, provocative swing," but the Guardian describing Peele's latest work as "clotted and heavy.""There's a million storylines within this and metaphors that anyone in the audience can take differently," said Nope star Brandon Perea.
