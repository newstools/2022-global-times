But added that "It's 'no consensus' consensus ... We [Chinese mainland and island of Taiwan] just put those complex [issues] aside and keep moving." He claim that the consensus allows for "creative ambiguity."His remarks were challenged by Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, who said that the 1992 Consensus is not to be distorted arbitrarily. Ma said that amid the increasingly complex and tense cross-Straits situation, any party, institute and individual who are devoted to push forward the ties should keep a clear mind, take a broad view and stand on the right side of history instead of going against it, said Ma.Ma added that on the basis of the consensus, the Communist Party of China and KMT conducted cooperation and communication, which pushed forward the development of cross-Straits relations. Ma further noted that Taiwan is part of China, and cross-Straits affairs are family affairs, which should be negotiated within the family, not by outsiders. Global Times
