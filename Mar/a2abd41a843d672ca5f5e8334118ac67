He expressed concern over reports that the vote fell short of the expected standards of transparency and procedures and included acts of intimidation prior to the session.In Friday's phone call, Guterres said the current stalemate required urgent dialogue to find a consensual way forward and reiterated his full support for mediation efforts such as those carried out by his special adviser on Libya, Stephanie Williams.Xinhua
