The US Federal Reserve, for instance, sent $107.4 billion out of its estimated annual earnings that totaled $107.8 billion to the US Treasury in 2021. As to market estimates that the profit transfer implies an injection of 1 trillion yuan into base money, equal to a 50 basis point reserve requirement cut, the Shanghai Securities News said in a report on Wednesday that it's not equivalent to such a cut, but it could help revitalize the economy in a way similar to that resulting from reduced reserve requirements for banks.
