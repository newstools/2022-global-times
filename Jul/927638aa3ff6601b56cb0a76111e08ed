This showed that the PLA can potentially send drones to Taiwan without facing major threats in a possible cross-Straits conflict. These drones are of lower cost and do not have pilots, giving an advantage, the expert said. The drone only conducted reconnaissance in Monday’s mission, but if a real conflict were to break out, countless drones can carry out all sorts of missions including reconnaissance, attack, target indication, damage evaluation, electronic warfare and communications relay, the expert said.It again showed the great military strength gap between the Chinese mainland and the island of Taiwan, and that the PLA has overwhelming advantages that can safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, analysts said.
