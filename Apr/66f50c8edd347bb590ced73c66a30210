(Photo by Attila Volgyi/Xinhua)The final results of Hungary's parliamentary elections were published Saturday by Hungary's National Election Office(NVI), confirming the landslide victory of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition.The Fidesz-KDNP coalition will take 135 of the 199 seats in Hungary's parliament, NVI informed on Saturday, after counting the last votes cast in the Parliamentary elections held on April 3.The opposition alliance, consisting of the Democratic Coalition, Jobbik, LMP, Momentum Movement, Hungarian Socialist Party and Dialogue for Hungary, received 57 seats, one more than immediately after the initial count.The opposition parties, spanning a wide political spectrum, have decided to unite with the aim of having more chances at unseating the government of Prime Minister Orban, who secured his fifth, and fourth consecutive election triumph two weeks ago.The far-right Mi Hazank Mozgalom (Our Homeland Movement) got six seats, one fewer than the count right after the Sunday elections vote showed.The representative of the National Self-Government of Germans in Hungary secured a single seat in parliament.NVI's final count determines how many seats each party is going to get, but the parties have a few weeks to decide who will get the seats, as some candidates appeared on the list for symbolic reasons only.Xinhua
