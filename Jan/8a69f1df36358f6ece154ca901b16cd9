European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen makes a statement on the death of European Parliament President David Sassoli, at EU headquarters in Brussels, on January 11, 2022. Sassoli died early on the day at a hospital in Italy, his spokesman said on Twitter.

Growth comes before stability," Le Maire said, with France in favor of allowing the massive investments needed to green Europe's economy to be absolved from the rules.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking during a visit to Spain, defended the pact."Europe must continue to march together in the coming years and we'll do so ... on the basis of our stability and growth pact, which provides an important framework," he said. He pointed out that it served as the basis underpinning the bloc's COVID-19 economic recovery plan.The discussion is not expected to begin in earnest until June, Lindner told reporters, when the European Commission is expected to table its proposal to amend the rules.The commission's executive vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, said it held no "pre-cooked ideas or predetermined positions," and the EU's executive would listen to member states in a "constructive spirit."The debate will rumble on until at least EU leaders meet at a summit dedicated to the topic in March.
