The parties agree to partner from Tuesday until the next election when Parliament rises in June 2025.The partnership arrangement allows four budgets from 2022 to 2025 to be presented by the government during this time, meaning that the NDP agrees to support the government on confidence and budgetary matters. The NDP would not move a vote of non-confidence, nor vote for a non-confidence motion during the term of the arrangement.The parties have identified key policy areas where there is a desire for a similar medium-term outcome, focusing on growing the economy by creating green jobs that fight the climate crisis, making people's lives more affordable with housing and childcare, expanding and protecting the healthcare as well as advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples."It is about ensuring those differences do not stand in the way of delivering on shared goals for the benefit of each and every Canadian," a statement from the prime minister office said. "No one benefits when increasing polarization and parliamentary dysfunction stand in the way of delivering these results for Canadians."NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said later at his virtual press conference that he's not concerned if his party gets credit for enacting these programs and that his party is simply "using our power to get help to people."Xinhua
