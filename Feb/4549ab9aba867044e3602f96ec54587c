The skull of a modern human female individual from Zlaty kun on April 7, 2021. Genetic sequencing of human remains dating back 45,000 years has revealed a previously unknown migration into Europe and showed intermixing with Neanderthals in that period was more common than previously thought. Photo: VCGHomo sapiens ventured into Neanderthal territory in Europe much earlier than previously thought, according to a study published in Science magazine on Wednesday. Up to now, archaeological discoveries had indicated that Neanderthals disappeared from the European continent about 40,000 years ago, shortly after the arrival of their "cousin" Homo sapiens barely 5,000 years earlier, and there was no evidence of an encounter between these two groups.The new discovery, by a team of archaeologists and paleoanthropologists led by Ludovic Slimak of Toulouse University, pushes back the arrival of Homo sapiens in Western Europe to around 54,000 years ago.Another remarkable finding of the research is that the two types of humans alternated in inhabiting the Mandrin cave in what is now the Rhone region of southern France.The Mandrin site includes layer upon layer of archaeological remains dating back over 80,000 years."Mandrin is like a kind of neandertalian Pompeii, without catastrophic events, but with continuous filling of sands in the cave deposited progressively by a strong wind, the Mistral," Slimak told AFP.AFP
