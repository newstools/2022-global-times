"#Ax1 and all of the progress we've seen in the commercial space sector wouldn't be possible without NASA's collaboration with private industry."NASA is increasingly looking to private industry to handle operations in LEO, leaving itself free to focus on exploration missions to the moon and eventually to Mars.US real estate mogul Larry Connor, Canadian financier Mark Pathy, Israeli impact investor Eytan Stibbe and veteran Spanish-American astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria had blasted off on April 8.The crew were originally scheduled to spend only eight days on the space station but bad weather forced repeated delays. In total, the crew spent 17 days in orbit, 15 of those on the ISS - but Hassmann said Axiom and its crew did not incur additional costs because of the delay. Axiom had been keen to stress its mission shouldn't be considered tourism, unlike the recent, attention-grabbing suborbital flights carried out by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic.On board the ISS, which orbits 400 kilometers above sea level, the quartet carried out research projects, including an MIT technology demonstration of smart tiles that form a robotic swarm and self-assemble into space architecture.Monday's sea landing of a crewed SpaceX Dragon capsule was the fifth to date.AFP
