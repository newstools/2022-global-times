Orban congratulated the Serbians on the newly built railway, saying that the two countries have historical good ties."In the past 70 years we have been connecting countries in the east-west direction and forgot the importance of north-south connections," Orban said. "This resulted in an inappropriate situation that it took too many hours to arrive from Belgrade to Budapest.""So we made an alliance with President Vucic aiming to change this, and we will succeed in this effort." Once finished, trains will run at a speed up to 200 kilometers/hour between Belgrade and Budapest, bringing the Balkans closer to central Europe.The Belgrade-Budapest railway project is a flagship project within the China-Central and Eastern European countries cooperation platform.Xinhua
