Fossil of Stout Baiseosaurus Photo: China University of GeosciencesA team of researchers led by Han Fenglu, associate professor of the School of Earth Sciences at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, announced the discovery of a 250 million-year-old fossil of an early Triassic ichthyosaur from Baise, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to an online statement by the university.The fossil is a previously undiscovered genus and has been named Stout Baiseosaurus. The 3-meter-long ichthyosaur, with a stronger swimming ability, is currently the largest fossil of the early Triassic ichthyosaur found in China. The research results have been published in the prestigious international biological journal PeerJ, according to the statement.It took the research team three months to restore the fossil. Identification was difficult because it is mainly the upper part of the torso and key features, including the skull and most of the limb bones, were not preserved.The researchers were finally able to identify some key features through comparative studies and statistical analysis. "This specimen, although incomplete, has some features unique to ichthyosaurs and differs from other marine reptiles such as pinnipeds," Han remarked.Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that flourished during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. They first appeared about 250 million years ago and went extinct 90 million years ago, around the same time as dinosaurs.The origin and early evolution of ichthyosaurs remain a mystery. Ichthyosaurs first appeared in the early Triassic and specimens have been discovered in Japan, Canada, Northern Europe and the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Anhui.Most of the ichthyosaur specimens previously found are small individuals less than 1.5 meters in length with limited fossil material and distribution.However, the specimen found this time is quite large with an estimated length of up to 3 meters, much larger than the early Triassic ichthyosaurs previously found in China, according to the research team."The Baiseosaurus had longer, stronger forearm bones than other early ichthyosaurs, suggesting that it may have had stronger swimming abilities and may have acted as an advanced predator in the oceans at the time," Han explained.
