Places like the South China Sea and East China Sea are close to the Chinese mainland, and the PLA has enough means to counter the US provocations, he said.China operates "aircraft carrier killers" like the DF-21D and the DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles, under a complete combat system featuring powerful warships, warplanes and support units, observers said.From Thursday to Saturday, China is holding a very important military activity in a large area in the Yellow Sea, the Maritime Safety Administration said in a navigational notice on Wednesday, without giving more details.
