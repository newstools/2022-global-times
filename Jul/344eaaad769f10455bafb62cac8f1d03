The ongoing five-year project encompasses the restoration of the Basantapur Palace complex as well as exhibitions and others.The Basantapur Palace complex, which previously served as a museum before the earthquake, is expected to reopen after the entire project is completed.  Experts work to restore the carved wooden walls of the Basantapur Palace complex.
