Exhaustion among health workers, loneliness and positive COVID-19 diagnoses were meanwhile shown to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts, it found.The study also showed that people living with mental disorders had an increased risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.Gray said more research was needed to understand the link.One reason, he suggested, might be that people living with mental disorders may lead less healthy and active lifestyles, with higher rates of smoking, substance abuse and obesity than among the general public.Wednesday's study also showed that outpatient mental health services were widely disrupted in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, decreasing access to essential care.These disruptions were mitigated in many cases by shifting services toward online healthcare.AFP
