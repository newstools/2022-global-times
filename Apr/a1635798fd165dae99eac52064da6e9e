"It is still effective to take the original vaccine. This was proved in Hong Kong as it showed that inactivated vaccines are still effective in protecting people, especially those aged 60 and above, from severe disease and deaths."Recent outbreaks in China showed that many infections caused by Omicron were asymptomatic or with mild illness. Some people hesitate to get vaccinated thinking it is unnecessary. However, Zhang said that, on the contrary, vaccination is still necessary under this circumstance as it can largely help prevent infection and disease. Yang Huichuan, chief scientist from the CNBG, said during the press conference that the CNBG had built six manufacturing plants and three laboratories with protection level III. If the Omicron candidate vaccine succeeds at last, the CNBG will devote most manufacturing facilities to its production.CNBG's inactivated vaccines have been registered or used in 119 countries, regions and international organizations and the group has provided more than 3 billion shots to the world, Yang Xiaoming, chairman of CNBG, said at the press conference.Yang noted that the group achieved production capacity of 10 billion per year for vaccines based on various technologies, including a recombinant candidate and a mRNA candidate.According to Zhang, CNBG also submitted the application for clinical trial to the national health authorities for the recombinant candidate and the mRNA candidate shots.
