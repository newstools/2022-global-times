There has been no reported fatalities so far.WHO also said that the sudden appearance of monkeypox at once in several non-endemic countries suggests undetected transmission for some time and recent amplifying events.The agency added that it expects more cases to be reported as surveillance in endemic and non-endemic countries expands.Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild, and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through measures such as self-isolation and hygiene. Most of the monkeypox cases reported so far have been detected in the UK, Spain and Portugal."The vast majority of reported cases so far have no established travel links to an endemic area and have presented through primary care or sexual health services," the UN agency said.Reuters
