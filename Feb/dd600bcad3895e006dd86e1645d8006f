Waves lap ashore near condo buildings on the day the United Nations released a report with a dire warning for humanity on Monday in Sunny Isles, Florida, the US.

But failing to curb future emissions could cause an additional 1.5 to 5 feet of rise, for a total of 3.5 to 7 feet by the end of the century.Above 5.5 F (3 C) warming might cause much higher sea level rise because of the potential for rapid melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, but the precise level is uncertain because of current model limitations.Expanding monitoring through satellite tracking of sea levels and ice sheet thickness will be critical to improving models and helping inform adaptation plans, the report said. AFP
