However, the situation is still severe.For the regions with no new COVID-19 positive cases detected among communities, certain residents will be allowed to move within certain areas; but those communities with new cases will be still under "static management" with measures including mass COVID-19 screening, epidemiological investigation and disinfection, Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai health commission said at Wednesday's press briefing.  Shanghai will start a new round of mass antigen or nucleic acid COVID-19 testing from Wednesday to Saturday.
