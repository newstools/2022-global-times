Hong Kong Victoria Harbor Photo: VCGRights of the Hong Kong residents and businesses are more fully protected by the national security law for Hong Kong and the new electoral system, which help the city overcome chaos and embark on a new journey toward prosperity and good governance, a representative from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said at the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Council.Hong Kong radiologist Lau Chung-hang made the remarks at a meeting in the UN HRC. Lau said that HKSAR ­­­will soon celebrate the 25th anniversary of its return to the motherland. With the support and help of the central government, Hong Kong and its people will move forward with confidence.A speech delivered by another representative, a priest from HKSAR, said that the "one country, two systems" principle has guaranteed freedom of speech in religious and academic fields in Hong Kong over the past 25 years. These freedoms are more fully protected by the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong.Thanks to the support of the HKSAR government, the Hong Kong Church has been able to hold religious activities and open missionary schools. Moreover, religious figures in Hong Kong will continue to contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the priest said.When mentioning the US democracy, Lau noted that there is no one-size-fits-all model of democracy.The US boasts about being the world's oldest democracy, but instead of addressing the worst inflation in 40 years, high oil prices and children being shot in schools, it is waging a trade war and undermining international standards. This is not a kind of democracy anybody wants, Lau noted.Global Times
