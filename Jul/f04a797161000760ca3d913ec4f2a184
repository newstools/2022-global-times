And next year could be even worse. But we can avoid this catastrophe if we act now,” said Guterres,  noting that countries must transform food systems at every level to put affordable, healthy and sustainable diets within the reach of everyone, everywhere.Zhang addressed the meeting on behalf of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and elaborated that the group will work with countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to ensure that "no country and no one is left behind."Food security is a key area of the GDI. The group is committed to strengthening cooperation with all parties, adhering to the principles of solidarity and cooperation, multilateralism and a people-oriented approach, to jointly address the global food crisis, Zhang said.The Chinese representative also pointed out that multiple challenges such as the global food crisis have seriously weakened the coping capabilities of developing countries, especially small island developing states, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and African countries.In times of crisis, it is even more necessary to strengthen long-term cooperation in global food and agriculture, Zhang remarked, pointing out that the international community should provide emergency support to countries affected by the food crisis, especially developing countries.Zhang added that the international community should coordinate actions in areas such as food production, storage and transportation, food loss and waste reduction, increase investment, enhance self-sufficiency and strengthen partnerships between countries and relevant stakeholders."We should help farmers to increase their employment opportunities, eliminate poverty, strengthen the sustainable use and protection of food and agriculture, and protect the environment," said Zhang.It is necessary to maintain the effective operation of the global food and agricultural supply chain, ensure smooth trade and open markets for supplies for agricultural production such as fuel and fertilizers, maintain the multilateral trading system and remove unilateral and protectionist measures that violate the spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization, said Zhang.China launched the Group of Friends of the GDI at the UN in New York this year. Currently, 60 countries have joined the group to promote international cooperation, implement the UN 2030 Agenda and address global challenges. Monday's speech was the first joint address since the establishment of the group. This marks a new important step in the implementation of the initiative and cooperation of the group.
