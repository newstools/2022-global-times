They can exist in fish and in the environment for a long time, and are mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic to humans. Excessive oxytetracycline residue in fish can also cause damage to consumers' health.  Mainland customs said on Friday it would suspend imports of groupers from the island of Taiwan starting from Monday, after detecting prohibited drugs including malachite green, crystal violet and oxytetracycline in imports on multiple occasions since 2021.Chinese mainland imported fish and fish products from the island of Taiwan were equal to 284.77 million yuan ($42.5 million) during the first four months of 2022, official data showed. Total imports of fish and fish products during the period amounted to 33.09 billion yuan, meaning imports from Taiwan only accounted for 0.8 percent of the total.Global Times
