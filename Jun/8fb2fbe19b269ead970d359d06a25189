In the notification, the State Council also emphasized that all places should completely cancel the epidemic prevention and control passage restrictions for trucks from low-risk areas, and nucleic acid test results should be mutually recognized nationwide.Behaviors that cause serious impact on logistics and shortages or interruptions in the supply of goods, will be seriously prosecuted in accordance with the law, the State Council announced.In recent months, the central government has intensively issued policies focusing on logistics and stability of the industrial supply chain.On June 6, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the Ministry of Transport, stressing the need to further smooth transportation and logistics to protect the operation of market players and stabilize the economy. All regions and departments are required to strengthen the cooperation and prevent excessive anti-epidemic measures, and make concerted efforts to promote the positive growth of trade volume as soon as possible to support for economic growth in Q2.With the epidemic gradually under control, a number of provinces, including East China's Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Northwest China's Gansu, and North China's Shanxi have issued directives adjusting the cross-provincial anti-epidemic policies, strictly prohibiting excessive epidemic prevention. For example, on June 9, Anhui issued a directive requesting the removal of the epidemic prevention checkpoints on ordinary roads in the province.
