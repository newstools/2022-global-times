The consumer price index (CPI) skyrocketed 8.6 percent in May from a year earlier.With inflation well above the Fed's longer-run goal of 2 percent and an extremely tight labor market, the Fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate at each of the past three meetings. Last week, the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points, marking the sharpest rate hike since 1994.Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren argued that aggressive rate hikes would do little to ease the supply shocks that have driven up the price of gas and food, but could lead to a significant rise in layoffs."You know what's worse than high inflation and low unemployment? It's high inflation and a recession with millions of people out of work," Warren said when questioning Powell. "And I hope you'll reconsider that as you drive this economy off a cliff."Powell, however, said that "we do think it's absolutely essential that we restore price stability, really for the benefit of the labor market as much as anything else."When asked whether raising interest rates too much and too fast could tip the economy into a recession, the Fed chair said it's a possibility. "It's not our intended outcome at all, but it's certainly a possibility."Despite the optimism, a growing number of economists and analysts are concerned that the Fed's more hawkish stance could plunge the US economy into a recession.Economists recently surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have dramatically raised the probability of recession, now putting it at 44 percent in the next 12 months, up from 28 percent in April. The latest figure shows a level "usually seen only on the brink of or during actual recessions."According to the estimates by Bloomberg Economics, a downturn by the start of 2024, "barely even on the radar just a few months ago, is now close to a three-in-four probability."Xinhua
