It excludes the majority of several key ecosystems in Brazil, including the Pantanal wetlands, the Cerrado savannah and the Pampa lowlands, they said.They also urged EU officials to add more products to the controlled list, such as cotton, corn and canned meat, and to ensure due diligence measures apply to entire farms, not just part of them.They also called for "firm assurances" on human rights, particularly to ensure that agribusiness is not pushing indigenous peoples from their lands.The EU is among the first to draft such legislation since 141 countries signed the so-called Glasgow Declaration, a pledge to "halt and reverse" deforestation by 2030.Brazil was among the signatories to the voluntary pledge, launched at the UN climate summit in November 2021.But deforestation has surged in the country in recent years, notably under President Jair Bolsonaro.AFP
