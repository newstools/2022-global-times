Therefore, measures to boost consumption and investment in new infrastructure also have great potential.Meanwhile, a slew of supportive policies such as tax reductions for small, medium-sized and micro enterprises and individual entrepreneurs will help to ensure stability. Sheng emphasized the importance of stabilizing employment and implementing relevant policies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the nation’s job market, while also ensuring stable supply and prices, especially for key sectors such as food and energy.
