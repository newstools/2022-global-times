He was shot on his way from Kiev to Lviv amid the Russia-Ukraine confrontations, but was treated timely and has been discharged from the hospital, the embassy said, noting that it is trying to help him return to China. After the situation in Ukraine deteriorated, the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine started efforts to evacuate Chinese students from the country, and there were no casualties among them, a spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine announced on Friday to dispel misinformation.There are about 2,700 Chinese students in Ukraine that need to be evacuated, but time is limited and the situation is complicated, the spokesperson said.The Chinese Embassy has made strenuous efforts to make the evacuation effective and safe, said the spokesperson, noting that Ukraine opened a special express for Chinese students in Kharkiv and played a positive role in helping the Chinese students stuck in the conflicts. The spokesperson noted that the Chinese Embassy will continue with the efforts to evacuate more Chinese students.Global Times
