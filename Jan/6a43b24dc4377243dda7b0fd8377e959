For example, Taiwan enterprises can enjoy preferential policies in land-buying and loans, which gives us high hopes of settling and investing in Fujian," Wu said.Under these favorable policies, a total of 40,000 young people from the island have come to Fujian for internships, jobs and entrepreneurial ventures. Also, 95 architects, cultural and creative teams from the island settled in Fujian last year and 12 provincial-level exchange bases with Taiwan were established, according to the provincial authorities.
