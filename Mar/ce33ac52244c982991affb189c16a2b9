Any groundless accusations and suspicions against China are indefensible and will simply collapse. The West thinks the war is about defending democracy and freedom but in reality it's about security in European geopolitical landscape, so the Ukraine crisis is not about differences in social systems or ideology, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.Wang said that European countries should uphold the principle of strategic autonomy and work with Russia and Ukraine and other relevant countries to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture through dialogue and negotiations. The US and NATO should also engage in dialogue with Russia to address the root cause of the Ukraine crisis.Wang also said that there are many loopholes in the US' responses to the international community, including China's questions surrounding the US biological laboratories in Ukraine which Russian experts claimed to have revealed new facts pointing to the direct involvement of the US Department of Defense in the development of biological weapons components in Ukraine.The best way for the US to prove its innocence is to open its doors and accept the test of the international community, Wang said.
