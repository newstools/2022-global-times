I know it could be a challenge to present winter sports through music but the concert is very interesting," Zhao Cong, Head of the China National Traditional Orchestra, said before the performance.Members of the rhythmic gymnastics national team and swimming champions also attended the event. "For the first time I felt the music, art and athletic vibes are present at the same time at one concert," said Zhang Yuhan, Asian Games medalist in swimming.The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games is scheduled to start on February 4.
