However, Huang advised them not participate in gathering activities and take nucleic acid tests on time as required.The organizing committee announced on January 17 that it decided to suspend ticket sales to the public for the Beijing Winter Olympics to ensure the health and safety of those involved in the Games and, instead, a designated audience will be selected for the competitions.The selection of the audience at competition venues is also a response to the emergence of the more infectious Omicron variant in Beijing, three weeks before the Winter Olympics began. "The audience is not the same group of people but chosen according to their interest in watching the games," Huang added. Given that the situation is under control, the next step will be to increase attendance based on demand.
