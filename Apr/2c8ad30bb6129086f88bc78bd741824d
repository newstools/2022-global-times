Illustration: Chen Xia/GTThe epidemic has reshaped how Chinese people view health and how they exercise. It has awakened people to the importance of good health. As a result, more and more Chinese people are starting to take better care of their bodies by enjoying fitness training. For many, home exercise is one of the easiest options. Over 40 percent of China's Gen Z population prefers to work on their fitness at home, according to a report. This is because it is not negatively affected by the weather or the epidemic, and can be done almost anytime. And even if without professional fitness equipment at home, you can use household items for exercise. For example, just lift some heavy books to enhance your strength. The convenience of doing fitness at home is expected to attract more Chinese people to get up from the sofa or bed to "get moving."
