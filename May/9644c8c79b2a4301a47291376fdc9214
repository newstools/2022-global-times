More than two-thirds of the American companies surveyed said that China belongs to one of their top three global markets for investment, Wang noted."China will study the suggestions put forward in the white paper, and provide more opportunities for multinational companies including those from the US," said Wang.Wang reaffirmed that China's economy will basically maintain a positive trend and hopes the US will foster a healthy bilateral relationship together with China by listening to feedback provided by American multinational companies.
