Denying the 1992 Consensus and deviating from the one-China principle will lead to tension and turbulence in cross-Strait ties, and that will undermine the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots, he added."We will strive toward the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and greatest efforts," Wang said."On the basis of adhering to the one-China principle, we are willing to engage in dialogue, communication, and democratic consultations with all parties, groups, or individuals in Taiwan regarding political issues between the two sides and the promotion of peaceful reunification of the motherland," he stressed.Secessionist activities aimed at "Taiwan independence" are the greatest obstacle to national reunification and a grave danger to national rejuvenation, he said.The Taiwan authority's denial of the 1992 Consensus, along with certain countries' connivence and instigation of the secessionists' provocation, will only plunge Taiwan into catastrophe, and cause misery for the Taiwan people, Wang said.He warned that no individual and no force should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.He called on Taiwan compatriots to gain a deep understanding of the benefits of reunification, as well as the fact that "Taiwan independence" leads to a dead end and that outsiders are not reliable.
