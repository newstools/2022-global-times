Because it's not just one region that lives off tourism; many regions do," said Baca.The vast majority of visitors to Machu Picchu usually arrive at the town by train, either from Ollantaytambo, 32 kilometers away, or the former Inca capital of Cusco city, 72 kilometers away.The site of the citadel is not closed but with the train tracks damaged, the only way to access the town is to take a bus to a place called Hidroelectrica, more than six hours from Cusco city, and then walk eight kilometers through the jungle along the Ruta Amazonica.AFP
