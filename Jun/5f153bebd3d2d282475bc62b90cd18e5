Consumption contracted 6.7 percent in May, compared with an 11.1 percent drop in April. Fixed asset investment in May picked up 0.72 percent from April, indicating that investment momentum has clearly recovered, Wu said."As the epidemic situation improves and policy support accelerates, the economy is expected to improve, with a GDP growth of around 1.4 percent in the second quarter," Wu said.
