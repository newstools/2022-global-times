She also announced a plan to find alternatives to Russian fuels by 2027 in order to reduce EU's dependence on Russia."There's the law of unintended consequences," US-China Business Council President Craig Allen told Xinhua earlier this week, commenting on the potential economic impact of Western sanctions on Russia."What you intend to do, perhaps is punish Russia, but there are unintended consequences to every action. And it's too early to be able to say, what are the unintended consequences of this," Allen said.
