As for the types of grains purchased, middle-late stage rice reached 132.6 billion jin, and corn 233.1 billion jin, an increase of 39.1 billion jin year-on-year, the grains with the highest purchase volume and the largest increase.Soybeans amounted to 4.8 billion jin, basically the same as the previous year.This year, while doing a good job in epidemic prevention and control, all localities and departments will continue to focus on grain production, further increase investment in agricultural infrastructure projects, such as high-standard farmland construction, enhance agricultural disaster response level and improve comprehensive grain production capacity,the administration said.Additionally, the authorities mentioned that grain production in summer should be better than expected as relevant departments at all levels and grain enterprises have made preparations for the purchase of summer grain in advance.The harvest also comes as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine triggered a rise of international grain prices over the recent months. Observers pointed out that the crisis in Ukraine has had a limited impact on domestic food prices and supplies of agricultural products. However, they made calls to be vigilant of the development of the situation.China significantly increased grain exports on a monthly basis in April, even as more countries restricted food exports or intervened food trade. Grain exports totaled 312,000 tons in April, up 97.4 percent month-on-month. From January to April, grain exports totaled 916,000 tons, according to statistics released on Monday by the General Administration of Customs of China.
