BRICS Photo: VCGChinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that China will actively promote the expansion of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and welcome more global partners to join the family. Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks on Friday at a press briefing in response to media questions over China’s view on expanding BRICS as the rotating chair in 2022 following Russia’s comment on supporting China’s initiative to expand the membership of the BRICS. Meanwhile, countries including Argentina have expressed their willingness to join BRICS in 2022.   Wang stressed that the recently held BRICS Foreign Ministers’ Meeting backed the expansion of the initiative while the "BRICS Plus" consultation was also held as part of the ministers’ meeting, which fully demonstrated that the BRICS cooperation is open and inclusive. China will further promote the expansion with all parties involved to establish related standards and process. BRICS is a significant mechanism for connecting emerging markets and developing countries as well as a significant cooperative platform for South-South Cooperation, while the development momentum and cooperation in various fields continue to deepen over the past 16 years. BRICS will strengthen cooperation with other emerging markets and developing countries amid the current complicated international environment to further maintain the mutual benefits and development space for these groups. For instance, Wang said that BRICS’ New Development Bank has already welcomed its new members from the first expansion, which will provide financial support to more developing countries while enhancing the voice and influence of banks in the international system.  Global Times
