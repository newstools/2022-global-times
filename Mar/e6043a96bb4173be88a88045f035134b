As of the end of last year, digital yuan pilot scenarios had exceeded 8 million, with a total of 261 million personal wallets being launched and a total transaction value of 87.56 billion yuan ($11.2 billion).Industry analysts noted that through the previous pilots, digital yuan wallets have been recognized by the market with technical and scenario advantages, and now it is time for further expansion of the pilot."Especially during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the digital yuan showed more attractiveness as it was available for international users for the first time, further expanding its user base and application scenarios," Wang said.As the West excluded Russia from the SWIFT interbank system amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Wang noted that the move may speed up the Chinese digital currency's internationalization thanks to its various application scenarios and safety. Global Times
