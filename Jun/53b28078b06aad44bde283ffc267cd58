The US held immigrants in harsh conditions in immigration detention centers, where they often suffered from abuse, violence and inhumane treatment. Violent law enforcement against immigrants in the US claimed 557 lives in 2021, more than double the previous year, Zhao said. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the US, in defiance of the international community, has accelerated the repatriation of thousands of illegal immigrants infected with the virus, which has directly led to a worsening of the epidemic in many Latin American countries, Zhao said.The US should seriously review and correct its own bad record on the migrant issues, take concrete measures to protect the human rights and basic rights of migrants, and prevent similar tragedies from reoccurring, Zhao said. Global Times
