There is no one who opposes education for women," said Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, long one of the most secretive Taliban leaders and who only showed his face in public for the first time in March.He argued that girls could already go to primary school. "Above that grade, the work is continuing on a mechanism" to allow girls to attend secondary school, he said in his first televised interview.Haqqani hinted that the "mechanism" was linked to school dress codes, explaining that education should be based on Afghan "culture" and "Islamic rules and principles," and referred "more broadly" to the issue of women wearing the hijab.After their return to power, the Taliban demanded that women wear at least a hijab, a scarf covering the head but revealing the face. But since the beginning of May, they have instead forced them to wear a full veil in public and preferably a burqa, which had been compulsory when they first ran the country between 1996 and 2001. AFP
