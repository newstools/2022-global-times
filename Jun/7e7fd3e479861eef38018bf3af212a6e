The gang's leader told police that he was “inspired” to manufacture drugs by the plot of a foreign TV series.In May 2021, the Xi’an police received a report from the public that a drug trafficking gang was operating in the city. A task force was set up immediately. In June 2021, after confessions from drug users and traffickers, police arrested the drug manufacturer, surnamed Han, who was also the leader of the gang. The task force searched Han's drug production site, and seized more than 10 kilograms of various types of finished and semi-finished drugs and more than 20 kinds of raw materials for drug production. They also seized more than 10 sets of drug production equipment and instruments, Chinese newspaper Legal Daily reported on Tuesday.During his interrogation, Han claimed to be an avid chemistry enthusiast. He said he got the idea for making methamphetamine after watching a foreign TV drama about drug production in 2018, according to Legal Daily. "Anyone who can make methamphetamine is considered a true master" – this line from the TV series was imprinted in Han’s heart. He made up his mind to become such a master.In October 2018, Han settled in a small village in Xingping district in Xi’an and rented a house. He built a shed in the yard with a simple operating table, refrigerator, freezer, and an iron shelf full of bottles and jars.After three years of “self-learning,” in March 2021, Han successfully produced methamphetamine. After that, he formed a complete chain of drug production, drug trafficking and drug use with his cousin surnamed Du and others.The investigation into the case is still continuing.
