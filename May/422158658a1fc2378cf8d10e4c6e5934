Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives with his dog Dilyn at the Methodist Hall in central London to cast his vote in local elections on May 5, 2022. Polls opened across the UK in local and regional elections that could prove historic in Northern Ireland and heap further pressure on embattled Johnson.

This is something that just needs to be fixed."Johnson's government has warned it is ready to take unilateral action "to stabilize the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found" to key sticking points with the protocol.Ministers have argued that it does not command cross-community support and that London needs to protect the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of sectarian violence over British rule in Northern Ireland.But the European Union has repeatedly ruled out renegotiating the terms of the deal.The standoff comes as political tensions rise in Belfast after historic elections last week saw pro-Irish nationalists Sinn Fein become the biggest party for the first time and now bidding to lead a power-sharing executive.However, the latest UK threats to overhaul the arrangements unilaterally have caused consternation in Brussels, Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said as he met Northern Irish leaders.AFP
