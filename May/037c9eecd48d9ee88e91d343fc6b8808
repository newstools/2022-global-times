Observers believe this trip will be a milestone for relations between China and the entire region.Wang's trip is expected to cover cooperation and deals in a wide range of fields including economy, infrastructure, climate change, public health, policing and security, experts said. Agricultural cooperation is already producing results. One example is an online training lands in Kiribati, a South Pacific nation relies on coconut as its main industry. In November 2021, under the coordination of the Chinese Embassy in Kiribati, the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences and local authority jointly held a video training conference on comprehensive utilization of coconut industry, with more than 100 participants covering Chinese experts and company representatives.The participants exchanged views on improving the value of existing coconut products, exporting coconut products to China, and improving the research capacity of coconut industry development through visiting China in the future.The Coconut Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences has also drafted a Kiribati coconut processing technology and equipment selection plan, in an effort to help local coconut industry grow better, Xu Lijing, Director of International Cooperation and Exchange Center, at the Coconut Research Institute, told the Global Times on Friday.Another project is in the Federated States of Micronesia, where China helped build a Standardized Coconut Plantation. The plantation, also a flagship project under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is becoming an important base for agricultural technology demonstration and promotion in the country.Moreover, three training courses were also held for local people over the past several years. Through the demonstration of coconut wide and narrow row planting models and a variety of three-dimensional economic models of coconut orchards, local farmers have grasped techniques of standardized coconut production and also learned the biological control technology of pests and diseases, Xu introduced.Due to reasons such as underdeveloped land and agricultural technology, core agricultural products cannot meet the needs of local people in Micronesia, and the high cost of agricultural production and backward technology make it difficult for local people to earn money from agricultural production. For Micronesia, agricultural technical assistance is the most direct and effective way to improve the life quality for local people, Xu said.

The decision came after a meeting held in Nadi, Fiji's third largest city, between China's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and his counterparts of the Pacific Island countries such as Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu."We believe that China and the Pacific Island states enjoy a great potential for agricultural cooperation thanks to our mutual complementarity, and our further cooperation will be significant to enhancing peoples' well-being and deepening our comprehensive strategic partnership that features mutual respect and common development," the ministers said.
