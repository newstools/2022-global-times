China should not be made an issue, still less should China's internal affairs be interfered in," Zhao stressed. All parties should be committed to pursuing openness instead of isolation, and seek integration rather than decoupling to jointly strive for steady recovery of the world economy, Zhao said.Unfortunately, China's cooperative attitude has not been reciprocated by Japan and its Western partners. At the summit, both sides continued to speculate about China's threats as well as interfere in its internal affairs, which is a misinterpretation of China and an over-consumption of the Ukraine crisis, Li said.Japan joined some Western powers in simplifying complex geopolitics into a so-called clash of ideologies and values, and has again used this framework toward China and spread negative rhetoric about it, Li noted. As Japan's recent moves are increasingly leaning to the NATO-led West, actively joining the sanctions against Russia, echoing the US-led Indo-Pacific strategy, and possibly even participating in NATO summits, experts said, noting that these practices will constitute a serious threat not only to the security of its East Asian neighbors, but will also put Japan in its worst security environment since WWII."The security of the Asia-Pacific region needs to be maintained by all countries in the region," Li said. "If Japan attempts to bring in the US or EU, it will only create confrontation in the region, or even a Cold War-like pattern, which would be detrimental to the region and countries within it," he said. To counter the negative tendency, countries in the Asia-Pacific region should unite to establish a new regional security concept that is safe and sustainable, and solve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation, observers noted.
