Some 85 percent of Britain's population aged 12 or over have had at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and two thirds of the population - including the vast majority of those most at risk - have had three.Britain's death toll of more than 160,000 fatalities within 28 days of infection is the second-highest in Europe after Russia's. Relative to the size of Britain's population, it is 6 percent higher than the average for the European Union.COVID-19 restrictions are unpopular with many members of Johnson's Conservative Party, who view them as disproportionate given widespread take-up of vaccines."Pharmaceutical interventions, led by the vaccination program, will continue to be our first line of defense," the government said.Reuters
