Their touching moves have been welcomed by netizens throughout China. On Monday, the hashtag concerning the news that Ouyang Nana, a 21-year-old musician and actress from Taiwan, donated needed masks and protective gear to Shanghai, which is under lockdown due to COVID-19 prevention and control measures, went viral on Chinese social media after one of her fans shared the news on Sina Weibo earlier that day.Later that same day, the young cello player confirmed the news in a post of her own on the platform: “The donation has been completed through the Fosun Foundation in Shanghai.”She noted that supplies such as protective suits, face masks and shoes will be sent to 25 communities across Shanghai.Netizens who were the recipients of such donations also expressed their appreciation on social media. One beneficiary noted that “it is very commendable of Ouyang Nana, as she is the first post-2000 celebrity to donate to Shanghai during this surge.”Meanwhile other Taiwan celebrities living in Shanghai also expressed their support for the control and prevention measures in the city.The 68-year-old stage actor Lee Li-chun has been recording his quarantine life through videos on Chinese short video platform Douyin, telling his fans to stay positive.“We all need to relax, people can read a book, do some exercises or simply watch their phone. But no matter what, always remember to keep a light mood and do not leave hash words in each other’s comment sections on social media,” Li shared on Douyin.Another Taiwan actor Will Liu has also found a different way to cheer up his fans quarantined in Shanghai – holding exercise sessions with his wife for people staying at home. More than 130,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the city since the latest outbreak began in March, with an average of over 10,000 daily infections.Provinces around Shanghai, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have also provided over 60,000 temporary spare rooms as quarantine sites for people in Shanghai who have tested positive for COVID-19.
