A missile from Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, designed to intercept and destroy incoming short-range rockets and artillery shells, lights the sky in the central Gaza Strip on April 21, 2022. Israeli jets struck Gaza in the early hours of April 21, 2022, witnesses and security sources said, hours after militants in the Palestinian enclave fired a rocket into the Jewish state.
