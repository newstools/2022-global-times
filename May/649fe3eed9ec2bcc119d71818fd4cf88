Another 14 buyers have asked for the paperwork needed to set them up, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.With Russia's counter-sanction tools, the previous EU's five rounds of sanctions against Russia have neither produced immediate harm on the latter's economy or achieved designed effectives, so the sixth round focuses on energy imports - the biggest trading category between Russia and the EU, hoping this could inflict massive harm on Russia, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. But analysts said that the EU, which relies on around 37 percent of oil imports from Russia, would also bear the dire consequence of the sanction.European buyers have been struggling for weeks to figure out how they can pay for Russian gas in rubles as Moscow demanded and not fall afoul of EU sanctions.Trying to bypass the restrictions, European buyers have to set up two accounts with Gazprombank to facilitate the transaction: one in a foreign currency and another in rubles.A Gazprom source told Bloomberg that buyers only had to pay Gazprombank in foreign currency, which is then converted to rubles and doesn't involve Russia's central bank, and hence is subject to EU sanctions.According to Cui, the EU government and companies have reached a consensus on dealing with energy imports from Russia. "The EU government will make itself look tough, sending out strong signals. But from the enterprises sphere, it's a technique issue on how to avoid sanctions but still buy natural gas from Russia," Cui noted.However, to date, the EU sanction plan has still drawn backlash from a slew of EU countries. Hungary said it would still block sanctions on Russian oil. The country gets 85 percent of its natural gas and more than 60 percent of its oil from Russia.In addition to internal conflicts, it is also facing dual-pressure from both Russia and Ukraine, analysts said.Ukraine said on Tuesday it would suspend the flow of gas through a transit point which it said delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, due to "force majeure," Reuters reported."The EU is in a dilemma. On the one hand, it risks serious retaliation from Russia if the sanction proposal is pushed ahead, and in extreme case, Russia could cut off natural gas supply that will have broader implications for EU economy," Cui said, adding that on the other hand, Ukraine is also using natural gas as a card to push Europe on further sanction measures. "The arrow is fitted to the string. But how to shoot the arrow, and its impact is still an issue," Cui said.
