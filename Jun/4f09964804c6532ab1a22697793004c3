Pope Francis prays during the opening of a global child protection summit on the sex abuse crisis within the Catholic Church on Thursday at the Vatican. The pontiff has set aside three and a half days to convince Catholic bishops to tackle pedophilia in a bid to contain a scandal which hit an already beleaguered Church again in 2018, from Chile to Germany and the US (See story on Page 9).
