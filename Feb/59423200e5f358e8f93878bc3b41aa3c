Palestinians carry the body of Mohamad Abu Saleh, 17, after he was killed during clashes with Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank village Al Yamun, near Jenin, Palestinian territories on February 14, 2022.

The 17-year-old child, Mohammed Abu Salah, was later confirmed dead.Ben Gvir, a Jewish nationalist with a long history of incendiary comments about Palestinians, accused police of failing to react to alleged arson attacks on a settler home in Sheikh Jarrah. "Jewish lives have become worthless," Ben Gvir charged in a tweet before his visit.He told reporters in Sheikh Jarrah, where he set up his "makeshift office," that he would remain there until police "looked after the security of the [Jewish] residents." In a move that risked sparking fresh hostilities, Ben Gvir urged supporters to gather in the area. Palestinians were also called on to mobilize, while a group of Jewish Israelis that oppose Ben Gvir circulated a petition online urging people to head to Sheikh Jarrah as a show of support for its Arab residents.  Crowds of Israelis stood by Ben Gvir, chanting "death to terrorists" late Sunday, with a scuffle breaking out between Arieh King, Jerusalem's far-right deputy mayor, and Ahmad Tibi, a member of parliament from the Arab Joint List who came to support the Palestinian families. Ben Gvir later accused police of violently dismantling his "makeshift office," vowing nevertheless to "sleep here tonight."Voicing concern over Sunday's "violent clashes," the European Union in a tweet said that "irresponsible provocations and other escalatory acts in this sensitive area only fuel further tensions & must cease."  The Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, condemned Ben Gvir's "provocative and escalating move that threatens to ignite... violence that will be difficult to control."AFP
