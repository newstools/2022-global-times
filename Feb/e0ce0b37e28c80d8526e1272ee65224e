The sale will go live at 9 am Pacific Time in the US, but buyers can join the queue starting at 8 am. As the love affair with the mascot continues, the listing price of one Bing Dwen Dwen pin from the previously launched NFT collection surged to more than 10 times the issue price for the total set of three pins. The Global Times found on Thursday that the listing price for a Bing Dwen Dwen NFT pin listed on nWayPlay's marketplace ranged from $450 to $1,350. In comparison, the original issue price for the licensed epic box, which included three pins from among 15 types showing Bing Dwen Dwen performing various winter sports, was $99 each. Industry observers said that compared with physical souvenirs, blockchain-based NFTs offer better intellectual property protection thanks to the tamper-proof function. Global Times
