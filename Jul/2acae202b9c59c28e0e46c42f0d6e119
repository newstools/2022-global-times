New types of crime network represented by telecom network fraud crime has become the most mainstream form of crime now, especially under the current complex COVID-19 epidemic situation, Sun noted. To address these problems, China has worked hard to overcome these difficulties and has sent teams to Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other regions to carry out international law enforcement cooperation. Nearly 1,000 suspects have been repatriated from overseas, effectively deterring overseas fraud groups, Sun introduced.Recently, the case of assault against a group of women at a barbecue restaurant in Tangshan, North China's Hebei Province, had made headlines across China, sparking public concern over personal safety. Liu Zhongyi, director of the Ministry of Public Security noted on Monday that the case has caused widespread concern. "The Ministry of Public Security attached great importance to the case. It immediately dispatched a working group and experts from all across the country to guide the investigation. Currently, the investigation of the case is progressing smoothly, and details will be released to the public," Liu noted.The Tangshan incident not only came to focus in Chinese media, but also many foreign media outlets, with some outlets labeling it as "horrific violence against women." On June 14, CNN published an article entitled "'This could happen to any of us': Graphic video of men stomping on a woman's head shakes China to the core" and alleged that "the relatively light punishment for gender violence has failed to deter transgressors" in China, in an attempt to portray the country as an unsafe place.In response to these concerns, Liu said that so far, criminal investigation departments have solved 49,000 criminal cases and arrested 72,000 suspects during the 100-day campaign made to crack down on issues threatening public security, a campaign that started over the summer, effectively safeguarding public security.Since the regular operation targeting gang-related crimes, public security organs have cracked down on 249 gang-related organizations and 1,486 criminal groups, and have arrested 22,000 criminal suspects, the conference reported.Global Times
