In addition to speeches by Croatian and former Yugoslavian figures, songs and dances of Yugoslavian times were also performed to the crowds."Tito was and remains a symbol of persistence, principle, determination, courage and vision," said former Croatian president Stjepan Mesic, who was among the speakers addressing the gathering.The presence of so many people on this occasion proves how much significance Tito means not only for Croatia, but also for the whole former Yugoslavia, as well as the whole world, Robert Splajt, Mayor of Kumrovec, said.Olga Vodusek from neighboring Slovenia said he has been visiting here each year on this occasion, except that was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic."We are arriving here because this is the place where we can recall the good times when we all lived together, when we were richer and safer, in our common country that was socialist and democratic," he told Xinhua, lamenting the dissolved Yugoslavia as "a mistake."Xinhua
