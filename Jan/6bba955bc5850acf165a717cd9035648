We bring them here and treat them," said Sally Faysal, 27, another volunteer.If the animals need more specialized care, they are taken to a veterinarian. "The team members share the cost of the treatment," Faysal said.The refuge, just west of the Iraqi capital, consists of a main room where the animals receive treatment, along with a storage area and cages.It could eventually hold several hundred animals, and aims to, one day, become a veterinary clinic for strays.But for now, it lacks funding.The team was able to buy the plot of land for 25 million dinars (around $17,000) thanks to donations.Nazik, who declined to provide her surname, lamented that no public funding had been forthcoming "despite all the promotion we have done on social media."Iraq is trying to emerge from almost two decades of conflict and has been mired in a political and economic crisis, and animal welfare is far from a priority either for most people or for the authorities.According to the agriculture ministry, there are three reserves for wild species such as deer, but no facilities to care for urban animals.Volunteers said that before the refuge opened, their family responded with perplexity and even hostility if they brought an injured animal to their homes."There needs to be an awareness-raising campaign to stop animal abuse," Nazik said. "They are innocent, after all."AFP
