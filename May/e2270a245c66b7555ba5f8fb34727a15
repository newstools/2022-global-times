A few months later, it also suffered a record defeat at the federal level.Ahead of Sunday's vote, the two parties were very close in the polls, with the CDU having a slight lead at 32 percent versus 28 percent for the SPD in a survey published by INSA on Thursday."An election victory would radiate, in a positive sense, into discussions about the SPD's strength in the federal government and Olaf Scholz's popularity," Siegel said.The NRW election is also seen giving a boost to Germany's environmentalist Greens party, which could become kingmaker.The CDU has governed the state in a coalition with business-friendly FDP since 2017. But even with its slight lead over the SPD, it might not be able to secure a majority with just the FDP, which stood at 8 percent in the polls.The Greens most recently polled around 16 percent, which means either party is likely to need the Greens to form a state government.Last week, the CDU won by a landslide in the considerably smaller northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, but in NRW it will have a much harder time securing votes.Local issues such as affordable rents and public transport are usually what determines voters' decisions in state elections.AFP
