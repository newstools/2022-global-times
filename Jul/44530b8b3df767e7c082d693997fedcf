In the next four months, a number of contemporary artists will present their new ideas and understanding of this classic character.Beijing is the last stop on a cross-country tour that saw the exhibition travel to Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenzhen. The last will also be the largest as a total of 60 teams of artists from home and abroad are reinterpreting their "old friend" Mickey Mouse through paintings, sculptures, calligraphy works, installations, new media and even literature works."These outstanding artistic talents have explored multiple art forms to combine Mickey and Chinese culture together, presenting the wonderful Mickey art exhibition that we see now," Mao Qiang, consumer products manager for Disney China, said in a speech during the opening ceremony of the exhibition.Ever since Steamboat Willie, the first animated film with synchronized sound, hit the silver screen in New York in 1928, a little dancing mouse - Mickey Mouse - has captured the hearts and minds of people of all ages and across generations around the globe.In the past nearly 100 years, as societies, economies and cultures have developed and the spiritual needs of people have changed, Mickey Mouse has grown from the protagonist of early animated short films to a global pop cultural icon that has transcended cultural and regional differences and become a positive force of influence across animation, art and beyond. The spirit of optimism, curiosity and fearlessness that Mickey represents continues to propel the character to explore and push boundaries, making his legacy today as strong as ever.The current exhibition was held for the first time in New York in 2018 to celebrate Mickey's 90th anniversary. Disney invited artists from diverse cultural backgrounds to re-imagine the world-famous animated character, sparking a fantastical exploration of the possibilities of what Mickey means to our times.In 2020 in Tokyo, the exhibition was further upgraded to what we see now. However, in addition to the important artworks displayed in Tokyo and New York, the Beijing exhibition will see 34 Chinese contemporary artists contribute their own new creations featuring brand new definitions of Mickey. The exhibition, encompassing four sections, displays how the artists express their own interpretation of the character. Some put Mickey in a dialogue with current trendy symbols and everyday objects while others deconstruct and reconstruct the classic image or use the character to tell stories about their childhoods and the future.Apart from the excellent works from the 60 artists, three other Chinese artists' works will be specially presented during the Beijing stop.
