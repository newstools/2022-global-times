China's trade volume with Russia topped $140 billion for the first time in 2021 as China held onto its position as Russia's top trading partner for the 12th year in a row.China's exports to Russia jumped 33.8 percent year-on-year to $67.57 billion last year, while its imports from Russia, a bulk of which was oil and gas, rose 37.5 percent to $79.32 billion, Chinese customs data showed.In a signed article carried by Xinhua News Agency on Thursday, Putin said that "a mutually beneficial energy partnership is being formed" between China and Russia. "Along with long-term oil and gas supplies to China, we have plans to implement a number of large-scale joint projects.""The construction of four new power units at Chinese nuclear power plants with the participation of Rosatom State Corporation launched last year is one of them. All this significantly strengthens the energy security of China and the Asia region as a whole," Putin said.Market insiders said two countries, China, the largest energy importer, and Russia, the largest energy exporter, are displaying a growing interdependence on energy cooperation.Whether in terms of geopolitics or the complementarities of resources and markets, closer partnership of Moscow and Beijing are mutually beneficial and win-win, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Friday.
