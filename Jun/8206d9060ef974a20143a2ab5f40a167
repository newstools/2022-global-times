But considering the possible risks of prolonged delivery time via sea transport, we have chosen freight train, which is much faster and more reliable," a Ningbo-based trader told the Global Times on Tuesday.The cargo train from Europe to China has been relatively more reliable, and the number of freight trains jumped significantly this month compared 12 trains in May, a Yiwu-based trader, who is a veteran industry insider, told the Global Times.A total of 22 China-Europe freight trains from Europe arrived in Yiwu, the world's largest small commodity trade market in East China's Zhejiang Province, so far this month. And if trains from Russia are included, the number is 38, according to the Yiwu trader.About 60 percent of ships traveling from Europe to Asia in April and May this year experienced delays, per media reports. There will be longer wait time for ships in all of the major Nordic ports, Dexon International said.In a statement sent to the Global Times on Tuesday, Maersk said that the current congestion is not only impacting Maersk."We observe that a lot of European ports are facing issues with labor availability at terminals but also with trucking capacity available… many customers are taking longer to clear their cargo from the terminal resulting in higher dwell and high yard density impacting productivity," Maersk said.But Maersk stressed that "empty positioning remains high priority," and the company is planning to move empty containers back to Asia, not only from Europe, but also from other places to cater for the export demand.
