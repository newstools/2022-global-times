At least 41 large spy planes of the US military were sent to the South China Sea for such operations, plus other reconnaissance activities including those on the PLA Navy's Liaoning aircraft carrier group, according to a report by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank, on Thursday.It seems that the US is playing a new trick by rallying gangs to join it in weaving a close-in reconnaissance web on China, and the intelligence they have gathered could then be shared in the framework of the Five Eyes alliance, analysts said.Those operations could gather intelligence on the details of the PLA's military deployments and drills. Australia and Canada could report their findings to the Pentagon, which is building an alliance of spies, taking advantage of all members' technical advantages to block and contain the Chinese military strategically, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday.It is possible that more US allies, including Japan, could join the operation, Wei said.The PLA must be prepared to deal with these threats by detecting and defending against them, Wei said.With complete early warning systems, the PLA can track the spy planes and sortie fighter jets to warn them away if they approach sensitive areas, Wei said.Unlike US pilots who are relatively more familiar with PLA countermeasures and do not cry like a baby when intercepted, Australia and Canada accused the PLA countermeasures of being unsafe, but only exposed their inexperience, as they acted like clowns by complaining first while being the real guilty ones, observers said.If they insist on conducting close-in reconnaissance activities and making provocations on China, the PLA can send warships and warplanes near their countries, but only in international waters and airspace, giving them a taste of their own medicine, analysts said.
