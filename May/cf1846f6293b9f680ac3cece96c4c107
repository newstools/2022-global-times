The hotel has prepared meals and soft drinks for us that were placed in front of our doors. My kid had a good time," Liu said, sharing photos of her child eating a lunchbox that consisted of five dishes and some rice.They have not been told how long they will have to stay in the hotel. And although every one of them, including Liu's 3-year-old daughter, gets an individual room, the hotel staff has not made mandatory requirements for them to quarantine in separate rooms."Requirements differ from place to place though," Liu said. "Some of the quarantine hotels ask every single person to stay in separate rooms, even if they are from the same household."Another 100 people, including medical staff and security personnel, have been dispatched to Zhangjiakou to fully support medical and other needs of the residents.Some 5,000 residents in a community in Beijing's Chaoyang district were transferred for seven-day centralized quarantine on Saturday after 26 confirmed COVID-19 cases were detected in eight buildings since the compound was locked down on May 12.
