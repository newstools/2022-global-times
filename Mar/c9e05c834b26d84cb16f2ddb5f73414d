A comprehensive energy supply mechanism consisting of renewable energy and refined oil products has been shaped, but the problem of imbalance and inadequacy remains prominent, the document noted. The guidelines further state that a medium- and long-term goal of development will be covered, from the establishment of a resource supply mechanism, set up clean energy bases, improve energy infrastructure and service support capacity, among other aspects.  The region will promote scientific and technological innovation, demonstration and application, and push forward energy consumption transformation and upgrading. It will also strengthen energy security in remote areas and improve people's livelihood.Supportive policies will be carried out for innovative energy management and services. A mechanism for providing energy assistance to the region will also be improved to focus on targeted assistance and technical support, according to the guidelines.China has been making efforts to promote energy development in Xizang during these years, as the region is an important base of clean energy. There are outstanding clean energy resources in the region, mainly hydro, wind and solar power, with a potential development exceeding 1 billion kilowatts, according to Xinhua News Agency.In 2022, wind power and photovoltaic power generation will account for about 12.2 percent of power consumption, according to the guidelines released on Tuesday on energy development by the National Energy Administration for 2022.
