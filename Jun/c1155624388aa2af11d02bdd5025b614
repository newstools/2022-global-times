And FSM is one of three free associates of the US in the region and home to the world's largest and most advanced strategic missile testing site, it is obvious to all which country is threatening FSM's survival and development.Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday though there is a history of close ties with the US, FSM also strives for receiving more concrete support from the US, rather than only lip service. But the fact is that some people in FSM are reduced to political megaphones and instruments of the US, and that's regrettable.Actually, during Wang's visit to the Pacific Island countries, Western countries, especially the US, have spared no efforts in mobilizing all kinds of megaphones such as political opponents and media to voice its slander against China, taking advantage of its historic close relations with the countries, Chen said. But Wang's visit has not been  affected by these negative sentiments  - Wang has been warmly welcomed to countries visited, received positive feedback for a visit that is about to wrap up after consolidating  fruitful and promising results.  In another virtual meeting between Wang and John Haglelgam, Former President of the FSM and President of the Micronesia-China Friendship Association (MCFA), Haglelgam noted that he was proud to make the strategic decision to establish diplomatic ties with China 32 years ago. Micronesia is sincerely grateful for China's strong support in Micronesia's struggle for sovereignty and independence, Haglelgam said, noting that China's assistance comes with no political strings attached which greatly helps the country improve living standards, governance, and promote sustainable development. Wang's virtual visit to FSM shows the strength and maturity of the China-FSM relationship, Elieisar said. Since the establishment of the bilateral relationship, China has always been sincere to FSM and engaged in fruitful and practical cooperation, which has greatly contributed to the FSM's social development and anti-epidemic work.
