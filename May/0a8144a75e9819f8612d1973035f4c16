On one hand, the lenders in some areas have accumulated comparatively high risks, which need more efforts to be defused. On the other hand, the risks caused by the pandemic and other factors are gradually emerging.In order to carry out further reform to the sector to defuse risks to the financial system, the officials suggested that the regulators expand the source of some funds, for example, deposit insurance funds, to cautiously bail out high-risk rural small banks to avoid a spillover effect. Meanwhile, quality banks, insurance companies and other qualified institutions are encouraged to acquire and merge with the troubled rural banks.As part of the latest efforts to forestall major financial risks in recent years, the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, has restructured the troubled local lenders – including Baoshang Bank, Bank of Jinzhou, Hengfeng Bank, and Harbin Bank, with strategic investors being introduced to replenish new capital to the small lenders.Global Times
