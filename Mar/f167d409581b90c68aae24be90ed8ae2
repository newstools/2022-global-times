A group of around 2,000 women staged a different kind of protest in Zurich, Switzerland which involved a mass scream to demand an end to domestic violence and demand gender equality on June 14.

The sole exception was Saudi Arabia.Contrary to what one may expect, the differences were most pronounced in wealthy nations.Within wealthy OECD countries, 61 percent of girls said that they agreed with the statement of the study, compared to 47 percent of boys - a difference of 14 percent. In non-OECD countries, the gap was still present, but the difference was just 8 percent.The difference was also greater among higher-performing students compared to those of average performance."We have no perfect explanation" for this paradox, study co-author Thomas Breda, of CNRS and the Paris School of Economics, told AFP.But the apparent oddity has been observed before, for example in terms of self-confidence, and of boys being more likely to study sciences and math.It shows, according to Breda, that "as countries develop, gender norms do not disappear, but reconfigure themselves."One hypothesis is that countries with more freedom ultimately leave more room for individuals to fall back into old stereotypes.These countries are also very focused on individual success, and so place a greater premium on the notion of talent itself.AFP
