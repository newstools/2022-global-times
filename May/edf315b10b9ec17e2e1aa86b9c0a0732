Wbsite of Chinese Embassy in the UK The spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK said on Saturday that China is firmly opposed to and strongly criticized Japan's words and deeds to hype the Taiwan question and maritime issues as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned "Ukraine may be east Asia tomorrow" during his recent visit to the UK.  Japan is hyping these questions to attack China by insinuation, the spokesperson said in a statement released on Saturday on the embassy's website in response to Kishida's recent statement. "Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow," Kishida said on Thursday during a visit to London, as he called for Indo-Pacific leaders to recognize that the invasion of Ukraine was not just a European problem, The Guardian reported.Asked about the implications for Taiwan, he said: "We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia," reported The Guardian.The Japanese side has kept slipping its own agenda in diplomatic activities, played up regional tensions by making an issue out of China and hyped up the so-called China threat. By doing so, Japan aims to find excuses for beefing up its own military capabilities and undermine mutual trust and cooperation among regional countries, the spokesperson said, noting that this is not conducive to regional peace and stability and will win no support.The Taiwan question is purely China's domestic affair that allows no external interference, the spokesperson noted. On maritime issues, China firmly defends its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We also stand ready to properly resolve differences with countries concerned through negotiations and consultations to maintain regional peace and tranquility, the spokesperson said.At a press conference on Friday, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, also said that "China firmly rejects relevant words and deeds of the Japanese side."If the Japanese side is sincere about maintaining peace and stability in East Asia, then it should immediately stop provoking major-country confrontation, and do more things that will promote mutual trust between regional countries and peace and stability in the region, Zhao said.Global Times
