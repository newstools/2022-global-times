It was in 1994 that the country got its first and only commercial ski resort, Tiffindell, according to Snow Sports South Africa, the officially recognized sports body for alpine skiing, snowboarding, freestyle skiing, Nordic Combined and bobsleigh and skeleton.There is "surprisingly" a lot of people in South Africa who like skiing, yet it is still a small sport, with major sports like rugby taking more focus, said Alexander Heath, better known as Alex Heath, the three-time Winter Olympian and the only coach of the South African national skiing team.

While the youngest skier at the academy is about nine, and the skiers are mostly school children.During the winter season, over 60 children would first learn how to ski at the development club, and then go to bigger slopes and be given instructions in skiing. Around 20 identified athletes at the academy will stay on the mountain for almost the entire season, and they will do ski training in the morning on the slopes for three hours or so, and then attend school at the resort in the afternoon.The two programs get support from the national Department of Sports, Arts and Culture, which covers some fees for children.Over the years, four athletes from the Winter Sports Academy have qualified for the Winter Youth Olympic Games and one even qualified for Olympic Winter Games. According to Heath, almost all the athletes of the national ski team came from the academy.Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 that led to the temporary closure of Tiffidal in the past two winters and related travel restrictions, none of the South African skiers have qualified for the Winter Olympics Games to be held in Beijing in February, although one skier who is training in Europe is still attempting to qualify."We were hoping to qualify for Beijing, but unfortunately it wasn't possible," said Heath. "I'm very sad that we wouldn't be in Beijing because we have some athletes that would have had the chance.""Going forward, I'm pretty confident that we would be able to qualify athletes, men and women, for future Olympic Games," he said.As Tiffindell opened when countries in the northern hemisphere were in summer, it attracted a lot of interest from overseas like South Korea, Israel, Italy, UK, Sweden, France and Morocco, especially for aspirants who sought for qualifying by making points at the competitions, according to Olivier, who organized these international competitions. She believes that skiers will return as long as the ski resort reopens. While expecting the reopening of Tiffindell, she said the development programs plan to reach more children in the country. "We are planning to involve children from wider areas in South Africa. We focus on local communities mostly, but if the resort reopens, we have plans to involve children from all over the country to join in our ski camps," said Olivier.
