something new tech-backed tracking efforts, which combine the efforts of researchers around the world, hope to address.In February, researchers from the Germany-based NewClimate Institute, one of Net Zero Tracker's partner groups, released an initial "corporate climate responsibility" report.It found net-zero pledges by 25 top global companies added up to, at best, an average 40 percent cut in emissions, not the 100 percent promised.Researchers noted that accessing and comparing data just for those companies had proven far more difficult and time-consuming than expected - one barrier to scaling up regular assessment of progress on thousands of climate pledges.Creating fast and reliable systems to document, track and compare action on net-zero commitments will be crucial to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, from rising hunger and migration to more extreme weather, analysts say.Net-zero emissions pledges can be complicated to analyze and compare, for reasons ranging from dramatically different baselines to differences in whether companies, for example, include emissions from their products and supply chains.Pledges can be met either by eliminating a company or a government's own emissions - which scientists say should be the dominant goal - or by offsetting a share of those through projects such as protecting carbon dioxide-absorbing forests.Many pledges currently rely far too extensively on offsets, with demand likely to far outstrip the supply, analysts say.Lang said tracking large numbers of pledges is a huge task and even his group's efforts will be limited.Besides following countries and companies, Net Zero Tracker monitors cities with a population over 500,000 and individual regions of the top-25 emitting countries.The tracker looks at the substance of net-zero targets and related goals, to try to provide a common set of benchmarks for public use by others who then track progress toward the goals.Researchers are figuring out if they want to expand their efforts to track progress in more detail or leave those areas to other groups with different kinds of expertise, Lang said.The ECIU group, for example, lists Climate Action Tracker, which monitors countries, as offering greater depth on national policy actions, as well as data converted into temperature rise projections.Leveraging automationNet Zero Tracker's work uses an algorithm to scrape the web for key terms such as "net zero" or "climate neutral" while filtering out irrelevant information, to more easily track and document publicly available pledges.Data is then turned into a spreadsheet people can review, said Zhi Yi Yeo of the University of North Carolina."The model is built to essentially go through the source and comprehend and understand the text very much how a human would," said the data scientist with the University of North Carolina's Data-Driven EnviroLab, one of NZT's partner groups.The algorithmic approach can be at least 5-6 times faster than a manual search by people, according to James Zhang, founder and CEO of Arboretica, a tech company involved with the automation part of the tracker.Zhang said the concept is relatively novel for the field - though his company has also worked on another recent project tracking nature-based solutions for climate change using machine learning and automation."It's not a new method, but it's new to this industry," he said in a statement.'Grab bag'The project joins a range of other efforts to hold climate polluters to account and press for the 45 percent cut in global emissions scientists say is needed by 2030 to remain on track for the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.Climate TRACE, a coalition of groups led in part by former US vice president Al Gore, for instance, uses satellite imagery and other sources to calculate greenhouse gas emissions globally.Though emissions from carbon dioxide are invisible, the group can track steam emanating from power plants, for example, and correlate such visible traces to emissions.The aim is to track all emitters on the planet, not just those who "voluntarily wanted to report their emissions," said Gavin McCormick, executive director of WattTime, a nonprofit leading the coalition's work on modeling power-sector emissions.He said typically only about 40 percent of private companies and a small minority of sub-national governments voluntarily report those emissions - and there's no quality control system in place to provide a measure of accountability.When it comes to net-zero pledges, "because it's unregulated, it's a total grab bag - there's no rules," McCormick said.Lang, of Net Zero Tracker, said his team hopes to gradually improve the efficiency of its efforts to reflect changes in data for even smaller companies within 24 hours.Reuters
