Actualized FDI in China from countries and regions along the Belt and Road Initiative and ASEAN members increased by 6.5 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively, year-on-year."The figures showed that China maintained high growth in FDI, with foreign enterprises optimistic about the country's stable economic environment despite outbreaks of COVID-19 and geopolitical uncertainty," Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.During a meeting held by the MOFCOM on March 31, participating foreign auto companies generally expressed a positive outlook on China's long-term stable economic development and market potential, saying that China will remain one of their most important overseas markets. China's auto production and sales increased in 2021, despite the COVID-19 and chip shortages.Many of them said that they will increase investment in China in terms of new-energy vehicle manufacturing, as well as technology research and development. They cited the government's support policies including the end of long-standing limits on foreign equity stakes in auto manufacturing enterprises starting this year.In the first quarter, the actual use of foreign investment in high-tech industries stood at 132.83 billion yuan ($20.84 billion), up 52.9 percent year-on-year. Investment in the high-tech manufacturing industry increased by 35.7 percent, and that in the high-tech services industry increased by 57.8 percent.Dong said the continuous rise of FDI in the country's high-tech industries reflected the results of China's industrial transformation and upgrading, especially in its manufacturing industry.Global Times
