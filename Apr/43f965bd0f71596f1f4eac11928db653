A missile from Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, designed to intercept and destroy incoming short-range rockets and artillery shells, lights the sky in the central Gaza Strip on April 21, 2022. Israeli jets struck Gaza in the early hours of April 21, 2022, witnesses and security sources said, hours after militants in the Palestinian enclave fired a rocket into the Jewish state.

"Based on what law?"Bennett had said earlier in a statement he had blocked the rally for security reasons."I have no intention of allowing petty politics to endanger human lives," he said."I will not allow a political provocation by Ben Gvir to endanger IDF [Israeli army] soldiers and Israeli police officers, and render their already heavy task even heavier." Ben Gvir retorted Thursday that "some Jews don't surrender to Hamas."Tensions are high as the Jewish Passover festival coincides with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Palestinians and Israeli Arabs carried out four deadly attacks in Israel in late March and early April that claimed 14 lives, mostly civilians. A total of 23 Palestinians have meanwhile been killed since March 22, including assailants who targeted Israelis, according to an AFP tally.AFP
