Different backgrounds make them learn about differences, share and communicate," he added. The show focuses on how these people from diverse backgrounds find allies and companions. For the contestants on the show, the director said that he hopes they can do something new that "people can enjoy but I have never done before." Diversity was the main factor behind the choice to bring on Ten and Santa as they specialize in two very different types of dance.
