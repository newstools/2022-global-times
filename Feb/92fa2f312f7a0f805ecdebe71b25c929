Zhao Lijian Photo: VCGJapan committed innumerous crimes during the war of aggression it waged in the past, and with a deplorable track record in human rights, it has no authority whatsoever to make wanton remarks about other countries' human rights conditions, said Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Tuesday, in response to the so-called resolution about human rights adopted by the Japanese House of Representatives.The lower house of the National Diet of Japan adopted a resolution on Tuesday related to China's human rights record which expressed concerns about human rights issues in China's Xinjiang, Xizang, Inner Mongolia and Hong Kong regions. Zhao said some Japanese politicians, in utter disregard of overall China-Japan relations and norms of state-to-state interaction, went to great lengths to piece together the so-called resolution. This is a severe political provocation against the Chinese people.The related officials from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged solemn representations with the Japanese side, and the Chinese side reserves the right to take further measures, Zhao said. There is no so-called human rights issue in China's Xinjiang or other places. China's human rights situation is at its historical best, which is an undeniable truth, said a spokesperson from the Chinese embassy in Japan in a statement Tuesday. Some Japanese political forces are politicizing and weaponizing human rights issue together with the US and the West. Their plot to interfere in China's internal affairs and contain China's development, through political manipulation using human rights as an excuse is doomed to fail, read the statement.  Global Times
