The Chinese Embassy in Fiji said some personnel from the island of Taiwan who failed to sneak into the UN Ocean Conference by trying to become part of the Tuvalu and the Palau delegations only bring disgrace on themselves. Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Fiji made the remarks at a press conference on Sunday. According to the spokesperson, there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China. The one-China principle is a basic norm in international relations and the shared understanding of the international community. It is also a fundamental principle affirmed in UNGA Resolution 2758. China is firmly opposed to certain countries that ignored the one-China principle and the overriding trend in the world, facilitated the personnel from the Taiwan island to wedge into the conference, and deliberately hyped this matter, the spokesperson said. China practices true multilateralism and supports parties in attending the UN Ocean Conference in accordance with relevant laws and rules, the spokesperson said, noting that China welcomes the steps taken by the party concerned to correct the mistake and return to the conference. It is important that the conference focuses on the sustainable development of the ocean, the spokesperson said. The Taiwan authorities will only bring disgrace to themselves when they resort to joining a foreign entourage in order to tag along and wedge into international conferences, the spokesperson said. The United Nations on Friday did not allow personnel from the island of Taiwan to be part of a delegation list of the Pacific nation of Palau at the Ocean Conference.Global Time
