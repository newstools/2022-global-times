"Praise God, have mercy on the dead."Rayan's body was taken to a military hospital in Rabat, according to a cousin, although no report has been given of any autopsy.The race to rescue Rayan was followed live across the world, and as soon as the tragic conclusion was announced, tributes poured in.AFP
