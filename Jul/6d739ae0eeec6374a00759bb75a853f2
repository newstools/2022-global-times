Illustration: Liu Rui/GTCar-hailing has become a habitual and convenient way for many people to go out. But controversies often emerge during the journey. The latest one is whether the passenger should enjoy the air-conditioner in the car for free? As summer arrives, many passengers often demand drivers to turn on the air-conditioner. But for the sake of saving costs, many drivers are not willing to do so. From a market perspective, it is unrealistic to either impose the costs on the drivers or restrict passengers' freedom to enjoy cool air. It is better to offer a price tag upfront when the passengers hail the car, giving consumers the right to know and the right to choose. Meanwhile, the car-hailing platforms should also think of ways to subsidize the drivers, or they may risk seeing the number of passengers reduce. It will then become a lose-lose situation.
