It is funded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.The attack has so far not caused any leakage of key data, but it still represents a huge risk, the university said. The university has been paying great attention to cyberattacks, with the application of regular cyber security inspections and technical monitors, as well as increased sensitivity among teachers and students to cybersecurity, it noted. The university reserves the right to take legal action, and will take measures to build a strong network security barrier as well as safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of teachers and students, it said. Over the years, China has been a major victim of cyberattacks. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has said that China firmly opposes cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms. Data obtained by the Global Times from security companies reveals details of at least 40 high-level overseas hacker organizations and more than 2,700 advanced cyberattacks against China in the past few years, aimed at industries, governments, universities, medical institutions,
