Restaurants found guilty of inducing or misleading behaviors that lead diners to waste food will receive a warning. Serious violators will be fined up to 10,000 yuan ($1,546).With the law in place, online bloggers will be banned from livestreaming binge eating. Media outlets that publish such content will receive a warning and, if their violations are deemed severe, they will be shut down according to the law.China's grain production has been stabilized to over 1.3 trillion jin (650 billion kilograms) for seven consecutive years making the country the largest grain producer. However, food waste has been a lingering threat to the country's food security.Approximately 18 billion kilograms of food are wasted every year in China's urban catering industry, Xinhua News Agency reported in 2021, citing a nationwide field research carried out by deputies to the National People's Congress.The country also loses over 35 billion kilograms of grain at pre-consumption stages, including storage, transportation and processing, the report added.
