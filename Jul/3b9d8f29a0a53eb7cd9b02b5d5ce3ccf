That is to say, it tracks the relationship between supply and demand.The rise of the index indicated improving jobs prospect, boosted by the rapid recovery of the national economy from the lingering impact of the pandemic in the second quarter this year, Li Changan, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies of the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The report said that from April to June, job applications grew faster than hiring demand, with the CIER index declining to 1.35 from 1.56 in the first quarter. In addition, the index was lower than the 2.09 recorded in the same period last year.In the second quarter, a good number of major Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai were affected by the coronavirus flare-up, leading to a decrease of job vacancies, as those places usually provide a large number of hiring opportunities, Li noted.Since May, as the national economy's recovery accelerated and the government's series of supportive policies had a positive effect, the employment situation has improved. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in May, the country's urban unemployment rate dropped to 5.9 percent, down 0.2 percentage points from April. Entering June, with resumption of work and production quickening pace, the jobless rate continued to fall to 5.5 percent."The government should continue to enhance financial support to the most affected industries like tourism and catering businesses, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, which can absorb a large number of job seekers," Li said.
