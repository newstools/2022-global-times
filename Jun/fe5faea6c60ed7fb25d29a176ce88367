All of the rangers and almost all of Selenkay's staff are Maasai.Even so, living conditions are still difficult, said Noolasho Keteko, one of the women from the Maasai village bordering the conservancy. The crop-haired mother of eight, adorned with colorful bead jewelry, also makes money from tourist visits to the mud-hut village and from selling jewelry. But when Selenkay closes in April and May for the rainy season, the village needs assistance.People in the district want to prevent the land from being sold, turned into fields and fenced off, preventing wildlife from moving freely. But a short distance from the reserve, a high fence already crosses the landscape to make way for fields.Income from credits could ease the pressure on the environment, said one of the guides, Nicholas Koyieyo.It would encourage herders to cut back on numbers of cattle, enabling grass and trees to regenerate, he said.Market question The big question is whether Selenkay's resources can be adequately monetized."Kenya has a very fast-growing population - the land price is also high [and] there are many options for land use," Brar said.The market for carbon credits is well-established, although far from perfect.Under it, carbon polluters can offset their greenhouse-gas emissions by "purchasing" emissions that are reduced or saved by other members in the scheme.But the much-touted market for biodiversity credits has yet to be created. On Sunday, preparatory talks for a UN biodiversity summit due in December finished up in Nairobi after making scant progress."There's no biodiversity trading market and we have to develop that," said Davies."We need carbon as a first step to get the things going, to get trust from the landowners," he said."A lot of money needs to go back to the community, so if we start to get money and giving it to the community then they will have faith in us," he added.
