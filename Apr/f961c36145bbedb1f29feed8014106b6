For example, an e-commerce application can recommend different products to individual users based on their preferences.In March of this year, the CAC said it would make crackdown on algorithm-induced information cocoons and algorithmic discrimination one of the 10 goals of its rectification programs in 2022.The watchdog said it had launched a regulation targeting algorithm recommendations, which took effect on March 1, to hold internet platform companies accountable and prompt the rectification of abnormalities based on improper application of algorithms.The regulation, jointly issued by the CAC and three other departments, prohibits algorithmic recommendation service providers from generating fake news or disseminating information from unauthorized sources.It states that algorithm technology shall not be used to influence online public opinion, evade supervision and management, and engage in activities of monopoly and unfair competition.In September of last year, the CAC announced a joint plan with eight other departments to set up governance rules and a system for algorithms in the next three years, in order to avoid the risk of abuses such as interference in public opinion, attacks on business rivals and harm to netizens' rights and interests. Global Times
