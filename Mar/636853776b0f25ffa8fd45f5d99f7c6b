It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing ... humanitarian crisis in Ukraine," he said.A New York Times identity card was among Renaud's papers, leading to earlier reports he worked for the paper.The International Federation of Journalists identified the wounded reporter as American photographer Juan Arredondo.A third victim, a Ukrainian who had been in the same car as the Americans, was also wounded, according to a medic at the scene.AFP reporters in Irpin saw Ukrainian volunteer soldiers rush the body on a stretcher to a more secure location before laying it out on the ground for further identification.Danylo Shapovalov, a surgeon volunteering for the Ukrainian territorial defense, said Renaud died instantly from a gunshot wound to his neck.AFP reporters heard small arms and artillery fire in the area, which runs along the front splitting Ukrainian positions from Russian forces."The car was shot at. There were two journalists and one of ours," Shapovalov told AFP."Our guy and the journalist are wounded, I provided them first aid, the other one received a wound in the neck, he died immediately."The New York Times called Renaud "a talented photographer and filmmaker" who last contributed to the paper in 2015.Arredondo said in a news video clip of him in his hospital bed that the reporters' vehicle came under attack after crossing a Ukrainian-controlled checkpoint."We were going to film other refugees leaving. We got into a car, someone offered to take us to the other bridge," Arredondo said."We crossed a checkpoint and they started shooting at us, so the driver turned around and they kept shooting."White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said US officials would consult with Kyiv to determine the circumstances of the attack.Renaud won Harvard University's Nieman Fellowship in 2019, which he used to report on a wide range of global stories, including Black Lives Matter protests in his native Little Rock, Arkansas.Renaud becomes the first foreign reporter killed in Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine war started on February 24.AFP
