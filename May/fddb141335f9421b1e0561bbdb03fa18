Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesChinese households' balconies have become tiny vegetable patches. As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, some residents stocked up on products such as fresh vegetables. However, many of the fresh vegetables went rotten before they were consumed. As a response, an increasing number of people, especially the young, have been planting vegetables on their balconies. According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the sales of various vegetable seeds on Taobao and Tmall platforms doubled in comparison to the same period last year. Sales of items such as farm tools and fertilizer have also witnessed an evident growth. It is unexpected that in the context of the epidemic, people's interests in growing vegetables can be inspired. Having vegetables grown by ourselves is a very fulfilling thing. It provides us a way to slow down our pace and enjoy life, learn from nature and ease our stress. And it also adds much fun to our daily life.
