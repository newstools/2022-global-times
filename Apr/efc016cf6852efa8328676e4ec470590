An internet company in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province, holds a unique hairline challenge in June. The prize is a hair transplant package worth more than 5,000 yuan ($700). Photo: VCGA man from Beijing has taken a medical beauty institution to court repeatedly over the past four years despite failing each time. The reason for his appeal is simple: He wants his money back for some 1,000 hair follicles that never got fixed to his head during a hair transplant surgery. Four years ago, the man, surnamed Zhu, went to a beauty institution for hair transplant surgery after finding his forehead sparse. The institution promised to transplant 3,500 units of hair follicles from the back of his head to the forehead. But after the surgery, Zhu noticed some abnormalities and counted his newly implanted follicles again and again in the mirror. Zhu separated his 0.08 square meters of transplanted area into nine parts and started counting. To Zhu's great disappointment, there were only about 2,000 follicles, 1,000 less than they had agreed. Outraged, Zhu visited China Consumers' Association, the local administration for market regulation, and the Beijing Health Commission, but had not gotten a satisfactory solution. Zhu finally decided to take the matter to court and asked for compensation from the institution that lied to him. However, as there was no place to identify the number of hair follicles in China, he failed to appeal again and again but never gave up. During a recent interview, Zhu said that he will keep on trying until justice is served. Global Times
