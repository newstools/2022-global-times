It comes amid the country’s latest fight against COVID-19 outbreaks.  The authorities called on e-commerce platforms and logistics enterprises to strengthen the construction of cold-chain warehouses and facilities in communities and commercial buildings in a bid to enhance the convenience of services for residents and address the “last mile” problem.The “last mile” problem refers to the last stage in the process of logistics in delivering goods to residents. The notice suggested accelerating the construction of infrastructure construction networks for cold-chain transportation, while supporting county-level logistics centers and transport service stations to expand service functions and improve facilities for storing and transporting agricultural products. The notice also proposed further promoting innovation in related technologies such as cold-chain transportation vehicles and smart temperature monitoring devices. It also suggested improving the supervision system and strengthening supportive policies for domestic cold-chain logistics. Shanghai has been strengthening efforts and measures to fully address the “last mile” problem and ensure that local residents can get their daily life necessities, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday. Multiple e-commerce platforms including Hema Fresh, Elema and Meituan have arranged for more than 1,000 staff members to support Shanghai, while ensuring that eligible local employees can return to their positions as soon as possible, said the Xinhua report.
