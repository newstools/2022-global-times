The local government also encourages Chinese investment in its agriculture. In addition to cooperation in the field of pelagic fisheries, Fiji has great interest in developing cooperation with China in offshore aquaculture, Chen added, believing that more seafood could be sold to the Chinese market after logistics channels are established. "Under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a number of Chinese state-owned and private enterprises have seen the opportunities brought by the initiative to promote economic and trade cooperation between Fiji and China," Chen said.The 14th Bureau of China Railway Construction Corp told the Global Times that the company has built six bridges in Fiji, which have met the travel needs of local people and economic development needs of the country.The projects have eased local employment pressure, with a large number of Fijian bridge engineers having been trained during the construction.Due to COVID-19 flare-ups, Fiji's infrastructure development has basically stagnated in the past two years. Once the pandemic has been brought under effective control, the country will enter a five-year period of rapid development in the infrastructure sector, and all Chinese firms there will embrace great cooperation opportunities, as the local government and people have a high regard of the BRI, the company noted."In addition to traditional infrastructure, we also focus on solar and water power generation as well as sewage treatment and recycling. Green energy and other new infrastructure projects will be the direction of our efforts," the bureau added.
