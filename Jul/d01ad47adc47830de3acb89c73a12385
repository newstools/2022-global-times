More than 400 people, including tourists and truckers, were stranded on Sunday by a fierce snowstorm in the Andes mountains near the ­Argentina-Chile border, with temperatures plunging well below freezing, local officials said.On the Argentinian side of the border, 120 people were rescued early in the day by police and military personnel, but another 200 remained stranded at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters due to the hostile weather.More than 200 people are also still stranded on the Chilean side, police officer Hector Castro told Chilean media.Hector Tello, an official from the Argentinian village of Las Heras, told Argentine pay television news channel C5N that "there are temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius, with more than one meter of snow accumulated on the roads." The powerful winter storm hit the region on Saturday, hammering the mountain road connecting the two countries together and stranding more than 300 vehicles along the route. The Los Libertadores border crossing was later shut down by authorities.The region some 1,200 kilometers  west of Buenos Aires has been hit by a polar cold snap, according to weather authorities.Evacuees were moved to shelters in nearby towns, and Tello said officials were aiming to complete the remaining rescues of those trapped by Monday.Weather conditions, however, "continue to be bad," the official added.
