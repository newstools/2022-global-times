In the Yangtze River Delta region with Shanghai as the center, the number dropped by about 12 percent, according to media reports.In Monday's notice, the State Council highlighted that any shutdown of highways, ordinary roads, or setting up waterway barriers should be reported to the provincial-level joint prevention and control mechanism for approval before implementation.For the closure of airports involving inter-provincial flights or international flights, local governments shall report this to the relevant departments of the State Council for approval as required.And, it is required to announce these shutdowns to the public in advance, and take active steps to end them as soon as possible, the notice said.Several industry insiders told the Global Times on Monday that they applauded these measures as they sought to beef up foreign trade flows.Despite the fluid situation, industry insiders are confident they can ensure the delivery of goods ranging from home appliances to face masks to markets including Europe and the US.There are disruptions to the supply chain, because some parts are made in or near Shanghai, where epidemic controls are strict. But companies can easily find alternative sources in the Pearl River Delta, thanks to the complete supply chain in the region, Hong Shibin, deputy executive director of the marketing committee of the China Household Electrical Appliances Association, who also runs a household appliance business, told the Global Times on Monday.Local factories for home appliances are generally working at full capacity.Moreover, some local producers and traders are transferring their export orders from Shanghai and the Ningbo port to ports in Guangdong to avoid disruptions, according to Hong.The supply chain hurdles are mostly in the Yangtze River Delta, where Shanghai is the center due to the epidemic flare-ups. The situation is relatively easier in the Pearl River Delta where the epidemic has been curbed, industry insiders said, with a limited impact on foreign trade.Foreign trade flows in the port of Guangzhou, the head of the Pearl River Delta, remained strong in the first quarter with double-digit growth in terms container volume, according to the Guangzhou port.A Guangzhou-based mask producer surnamed Cao told the Global Times on Monday that foreign orders remain strong, especially from some European countries and the US, where they have consistent business partners.A statement by the Guangzhou port obtained by the Global Times on Monday said that it had formed fast channels for goods deliveries.The port has added six container shipping routes, taking the total for foreign trade to 147 and strengthening shipping capacity to Southeast Asia while providing solid import and export logistics channels for companies in the Pearl River Delta.
