 Fair treatment expectedWhile there are general expectations that Indian regulators may relax its tough stance and probing activities targeting Chinese companies, the recent investigation targeting Xiaomi has once again put industry insiders on alert.India's tax investigations into Xiaomi might be part of its routine tax inspection work, but it should be emphasized that its inspection process was relatively "rough," which may affect Chinese companies' confidence in investing in the Indian market, Yang said.In the face of damage to legitimate rights and interests, enterprises must have the courage to defend themselves through legal channels, Liu noted.Industry insiders fear that the recent probe could be a follow-up of Indian government's move targeting Chinese companies.On April 17, 2020, on the reported grounds of preventing assets from being acquired by foreign investors during the epidemic, India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry suddenly revised FDI regulations, a policy change that has largely discouraged foreign investors including Chinese companies from investing in India.Since the start of this policy, the number of Chinese-funded mobile phone-related companies that have passed the approval of Indian authorities has been less than 10 percent of the typical levels, industry insiders said.
