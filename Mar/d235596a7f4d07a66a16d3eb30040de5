Public organizations regarding charity and philanthropies are encouraged to take the lead in establishing a third system of mental illness treatment - the social support system. Besides, special attention should be paid to improving the ability of faculty members to identify students' mental and psychological problems and to apply professional knowledge to deal with these problems.Focusing on the same issue, Liu Qingfeng, a deputy to the 13th National People's Congress and board chairman of iFlytek, a leading Chinese AI firm, proposed to enhance screening for depression among youngsters and include the payment in medical insurance.Liu also suggested introducing AI technologies in managing depression and other psychological diseases and establish an AI platform to screen these problems for nationwide elementary and middle schools. The treatment fee should also be included in medical insurance, Liu suggests. Global Times
