Officials from Chinese Association of STD and AIDs Prevention and Control, UNAIDS and AHF, as well as several Chinese celebrities sent greetings via video links. This year's activities called on more people to be the "umbrella holders" for children with HIV. A teacher named Cuicui at Linfen Red Ribbon School was once a student there. She said she chose to come back to the school after college graduation because she'll always remember that a teacher once ate the rice in her bowl and hugged her so tightly that she could feel herself truly accepted."The children who received the warmth and encouragement from the 'umbrella holders' will become the 'umbrella holders' of the future," said Guo.
