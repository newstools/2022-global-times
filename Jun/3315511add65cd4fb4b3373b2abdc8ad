In the year following the death of George Floyd as a result of police brutality, law enforcement officials in the US have reportedly killed hundreds of members belonging to minority communities in the country. American soldiers indiscriminately killed defenseless civilians in foreign countries during military operations abroad and the perpetrators of these acts are still at large.The Representative of China urged the Human Rights Council and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions to continue to pay attention to the issue of US police violence in the law enforcement department and to focus also on US soldiers killing innocent civilians in other countries, pushing for comprehensive and fair investigations of relevant incidents and bringing the culprits to justice.Global Times
