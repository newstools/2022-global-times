Hotels and other accommodations operators should precisely record the information of their customers and report to the police if they suspect something is wrong."The Legislative Affairs Commission requested public comments on the initial version of draft amendment from last December to January after the first examination of NPC, receiving a total of 423,719 suggestions and nearly 300 letters from the public.Zang pointed out that besides the effective prevention of crimes against women such as abduction and trafficking, public comments mainly concern issues of gender equality in education and employment, as well as female employees' rights related to pregnancy and childbirth."We will require schools to check the criminal records of teachers, volunteers and community workers to be employed and say no to those with sexual assault or harassment record. Employers shall not restrict the promotion of female staff because of their pregnancy, maternity leave and breast-feeding," said Zang.Zang said the draft will be further revised and improved based on the public opinion before being submitted to the top legislature for a second deliberation from April 18 to April 20.Global Times
