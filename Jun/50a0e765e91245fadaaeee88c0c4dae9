Illustration: Chen Xia/GTRecently in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, local police received a report from a resident surnamed Zhang who said that his mother was addicted to buying healthcare products and wanted to pay a high price for "medicines." The mother claimed the healthcare products "come from the regular way, and the quality is absolutely guaranteed." But when the police asked to see the packages, and asked for the production batch number and other information, she was unwilling to provide them. "You have to go to the hospital and consult doctors when you don't feel well," the police said. After patient persuasion, the mother realized the healthcare products do not have the health benefits the provider claimed. The elderly people are advised to keep an alert on these healthcare products tricks so that they could keep both their health and money.
