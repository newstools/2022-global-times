Exact cause of crash is yet to be ascertained," the Pakistani military's media wing said.It added that six Pakistani troops were among those killed.A spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres in New York confirmed the crash and gave the nationality of all eight victims.Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed his "deep sense of shock and grief," his office said, paying tribute to the global peace effort by the country's armed forces.Congolese military authorities in North Kivu said M23 rebels had "shot down" the aircraft. But the group denied this, instead claiming the Congolese military was responsible for the crash.The UN Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo (MONUSCO) said earlier in a tweet that it had "lost contact" with one of its helicopters which was on a reconnaissance mission in the Rutshuru region of North Kivu province where Congolese forces have been battling M23 rebels.The Democratic Republic of the Congo army has explicitly accused Rwanda of supporting an armed rebellion in the east of the vast country, charges Kigali denied on Tuesday.After months of suspicion and decades of mistrust between DR Congo and its neighbor Rwanda, a spokesperson for the North Kivu governor on Monday issued a statement saying the M23 "backed by the Rwanda Defence Force [RDF] carried out incursions and attacked positions" of the army the previous night.The attacks took place at Tchanzu and Runyoni, in the Rutshuru area, General Sylvain Ekenge said.To support his accusations, he added two Rwandan soldiers had been arrested during Monday's attacks, identifying a warrant officer and a private.The two alleged soldiers, dressed in civilian clothes, were standing next to him in footage shown on Congolese television.DRC Communications Minister and government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Monday night that following the army accusations, the foreign ministry would "invite Rwanda's ambassador so that he comes to give us some explanations."The ambassador, Vincent Karega, denied the accusation of Rwandan collusion, saying in a tweet that "Rwanda does not support the M23 politically or militarily."The governor of Rwanda's western province, Francois Habitegeko, also hit back on Twitter."We would like to categorically refute the baseless accusations and state that RDF is not by any means involved in the belligerent activities," in DR Congo, he wrote.He added that the two men displayed on Congolese television had been arrested "more than a month ago" and were not the soldiers named.AFP
