Any efforts conducive to a peaceful solution to the crisis should be supported and encouraged, and the most urgent task is to avoid the tension from escalating or going out of control, Li said.China has raised humanitarian proposals and will continue to provide humanitarian aids.The premier noted the global economy is already struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and relevant sanctions will hurt the world’s recovery and are in no one’s interests. China is willing to make constructive contributions to world peace, stability and prosperity, Li said.Responding to a question on whether China fears the Ukraine situation would affect China’s trade ties with Europe and the US, Li said China’s development of bilateral relationship never targets a third country, and will continue to develop ties with different sides based on mutual respect and the win-win principle, injecting more stability into the world. Global Times
