Editor's Note:Following rare optimism for cease-fire triggered by the talk between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul in late March, the "Bucha incident," which is still under investigation, in early April dragged the situation to a sudden turn. It is regrettable to see that, after the exposure of the "Bucha incident," the US and NATO, the initiators of the Ukraine crisis, have not shown any sign of urging peace and promoting talks, but tried to exacerbate the tensions by increasing sanctions against Russia and providing more weapons to Ukraine, which exposed their ultimate aim to use Ukraine as a chess piece and their hypocrisy in declaring to stand with Ukraine while disregard people's call for peace.
