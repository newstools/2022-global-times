A report from the Shanghai Securities News on May 9 estimated that around 1,200 people in Hangzhou would use the same testing site based on the population. There would be at least 750,000 new testing sites to be established nationwide, based on a model that only considers the nation's urban population, said the Shanghai Securities News' report. The Global Times learned from domestic recruitment platforms that applicants are required to meet relevant health-related qualifications such as a nursing certificate and study in related fields.Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said on May 9 that major Chinese cities need to establish a "15-minute nucleic acid sampling service circle," as the nation's epidemic prevention and control work enters a new phase in response to Omicron and other new variants, the Xinhua News Agency reported. The National Health Commission vowed on May 6 to rapidly upgrade the country's regular prevention and control system and improve nucleic acid testing and sampling mechanism for regularized testing.
