A citizen walks on the street in Siauliai, Lithuania, Nov. 6, 2021. (Xinhua/Xue Dongmei)China's customs has announced the suspension of accepting import declarations of Lithuanian logs, starting from Saturday, two weeks after Lithuanian beef was subject to a similar suspension.In a statement posted on its website on Friday, the General Administration of Customs (GAC) said that, recently, local customs in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province and Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu Province have repeatedly found quarantine pests such as sirex noctilio, monochamus impluviatus and pissodes validirostris in logs imported from Lithuania.The log imports were therefore suspended and the Lithuanian supervisory authorities were informed of Chinese customs' decision, according to the statement. The announcement followed a similar move earlier in February when the GAC decided to cut off the acceptance of import declarations of Lithuanian beef from February 9.The suspension of Lithuanian beef declarations is a compliance operation in accordance with relevant customs standards, and there is no need to over-interpret it, Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research Institute, told the Global Times.  Lithuania is considered to have come under growing pressure from Chinese public after it refused to abide by the one-China principle."What Lithuania should do is to face up to the facts, correct its own mistakes and come back to the right track of adhering to the one-China principle, rather than confusing right and wrong and slandering China," a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry said on February 10. Global Times
