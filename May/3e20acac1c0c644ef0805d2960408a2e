But the rainfall was too little and didn't dissolve them. The smell of the disinfectant spread and affected the residents, showing a lack of thorough consideration and professional infection methods by the anti-epidemic office.On Saturday evening, officials from the Shanghai Patriotic Health Campaign Committee invited other districts in Shanghai to learn from this case and put an end to unprofessional and incorrect disinfection practices during COVID-19 prevention.The committee pointed out what they consider to be not only useless, but harmful disinfection measures, including directly sprinkling disinfectant on people, in the open air and environment such as on walls, roads and lawns, as well as pouring large amounts of disinfectant or disinfection pills into drains.Disinfection of residences to prevent COVID-19 has become a hot topic after video clips and photos were posted online in recent days showing chaotic scenes at apartments receiving mandatory disinfection.At a press briefing on Tuesday, Jin Chen, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-rural Development, stressed that household disinfection is an important part of epidemic prevention and control, noting that the procedures for disinfection of the homes of people who have tested positive have been standardized.
