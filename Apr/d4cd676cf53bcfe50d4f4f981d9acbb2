But the group has optimized a set of collecting and optimizing mechanism to alleviate the situation. For example, it has helped the shipping containers ship back empty containers in non-peak time in advance, while encouraged clients to deliver containers via shipping and railway, rather than land transportation which is more vulnerable to the pandemic. Shanghai Port is the world's largest container port, with container throughout reaching 47.03 million twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEUs) last year. It also handles 17 percent of China's total port volume, serving as a barometer of China's foreign trade and logistics chain. Some foreign media recently claimed, falsely, that the number of ships waiting to load or discharge cargo at the Port of Shanghai had "skyrocketed to more than 300 this week, a near fivefold increase in the past two and half weeks."Global Times
