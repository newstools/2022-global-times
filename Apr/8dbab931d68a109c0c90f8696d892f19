Zhang Jun, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) Photo: CFPChina called on Russia and Ukraine to engage in dialogue and negotiation towards a ceasefire, since an early end to the conflict is the only way to resolve the existing humanitarian crisis, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun said on Tuesday at the UN Security Council.The Chinese UN envoy expressed deep concern over the dire humanitarian situation triggered by the Ukrainian conflict, emphasizing the sense of urgency on diplomatic negotiations amid the prospect of an extended and prolonged conflict.Zhang said that China has always stood on the side of peace and justice and has always acted by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. "Continuing to send heavier weaponry will not bring peace but only prolong and escalate the conflict, which will further aggravate the humanitarian catastrophe," the envoy said.Zhang urged all parties to reduce the harm to civilians as much as they can, saying that China supports the coordination on opening humanitarian corridors and organizing the safe evacuation of personnel, as well as the engagement of UN Secretary-General Guterres and Under-Secretary-General Griffiths with all parties in reaching a consensus on the humanitarian ceasefire.Zhang emphasized the importance of proper and equal treatment to all refugees, especially vulnerable groups like women and children, calling on the international community to provide more support to refugee-receiving countries that have taken in millions of refugees from Ukraine and may face huge economic and social challenges as the continuous conflict will result in more refugees.Institutions such as the UN High Commission for Refugees, Organization for Migration, UN women and UN International Children's Emergency Fund should continue to coordinate international aid to help ease the pressure on host countries, and enhance monitoring on the human trafficking of women and children seeking refuge, said Zhang.Zhang also stressed the negative impact of sanctions, saying that all-round, unlimited sanctions have had serious spillover effects, with developing countries bearing the brunt. "The vast number of developing countries, who are not involved the conflict, have paid a heavy price for it. This is neither fair nor reasonable. The international community should strengthen coordination to guarantee stable prices and supplies of food and energy, and avoid unnecessary export restrictions," Zhang noted. Russia's and Ukraine's representatives also spoke at the briefing on Tuesday. While the Russian side said Russia didn't expect to be truly heard by the others and that the US is seeking profit from the conflict, the Ukrainian side blamed the former for the current humanitarian situation.Global Times
