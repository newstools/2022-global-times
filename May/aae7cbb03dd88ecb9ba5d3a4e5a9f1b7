After 30 years, the entire expressway, equipment, and technology will be handed over to the Kenyan government free of charge.James Macharia, Minister of Transport, Infrastructure Housing, Urban Development and Public Works, said during the ceremony that the Nairobi Expressway is one of the best infrastructure projects in Africa.A senior official from the CRBC noted that once in operation, the Nairobi Expressway can significantly reduce the traffic congestion in the city, shortening the commuting time between the city and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. The project has won praise for creating a large number of local jobs, promoting the city’s economic and social development for the benefit of the local community.According to media reports, the Nairobi Expressway has created more than 6,000 jobs throughout its construction, benefiting hundreds of subcontractors and local construction-material suppliers.Global Times
