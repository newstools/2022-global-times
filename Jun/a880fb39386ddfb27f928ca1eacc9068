It is scheduled to arrive in Bandar-e Anzali or Anzali Port in northern Iran in about 20 days.The new route takes about 20 days less than sea transport and saves 6,000 yuan ($897) per container compared with the former international freight railway line from Yinchuan to Tehran, Iran.The train carried 51 standard containers with goods worth about $3.06 million, China's national broadcaster CCTV reported.Experts noted that the opening of the freight line is building a low-cost, cross-border freight channel for Ningxia and surrounding regions to link with Iran and the Middle East, which is conducive to promoting export of local products.It will also attract enterprises located in the eastern and western parts which are in the fields of light industry, electronics, high-tech and new energy to gather in Yinchuan and export their products to Iran and the Middle East. At the same time, it can help import rare materials, boost the rapid development of the logistics industry and processing trade and promote economic and trade exchanges between Ningxia, it neighboring provinces and Iran.Global Times
