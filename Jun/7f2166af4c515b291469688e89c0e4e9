A total of 218 air raids were launched, with 9,000 bombers dispatched and more than 11,500 bombs dropped. The bombers did not differentiate between military and civilian targets, with residential and business areas, schools and hospitals being among the main targets, which resulted in a huge loss of life and massive economic damage, causing 24,000 casualties, destroying more than 17,000 houses and over 37,000 rooms.

Liu noted this was the first time since WWII that Japan has taken such strategic positioning toward its neighbors.If Kishida joins the NATO summit, a regional hegemony could be formed in East Asia against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis to suppress China, Liu said. The expert warned of the rise of Japanese militarism and urged the country to draw lessons from history.
