On Saturday, police said they had been shot. A third suspect handed himself over to police, and told investigators where to find the boat. A boat engine and four drums belonging to Pereira were also found, the police statement said.Five more people believed to have been involved in concealing the bodies have been identified, it added. Last week, police said the men's killers had acted on their own initiative and not as part of a criminal group - a conclusion rejected by the Univaja Indigenous association, which had participated in the search. Univaja claims that "a powerful criminal organization... planned the crime down to the smallest detail."AFP
