Also, the increase in exhibition area shows the strong willingness of international brands to participate, highlighting their confidence in Chinese economy, he added.In a latest effort, the Hainan provincial government has announced it is issuing the second round of 100 million yuan ($14.81 million) in consumption coupons during the CICPE, CCTV reported. The first batch of 100 million yuan issued in April boosted local consumption by 1.56 billion yuan.China's retail sales dropped by 4.6 percent in the second quarter due to coronavirus outbreaks in some major cities. It grew 3.1 percent in June.
