Given the rapid growth of cross-border e-commerce and the well-developed online payment platforms in China, it will accelerate the yuan's internationalization, Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday.In 2021, cross-border yuan settlements totaled 36.6 trillion yuan ($5.4 trillion), up 29 percent year-on-year, according to data from the central bank. Local banks have also ramped up efforts to serve firms' cross-border businesses. For instance, the Bank of Jilin in Northeast Jilin Province set up a mechanism to offer tailored services for its major clients.In addition to the yuan's expanded use in the cross-border settlement system, many countries and regions have accelerated foreign exchange reserve diversification or started to set up different payment approaches, other than depending on the US dollar.For instance, during the just-concluded G20 meeting held in Indonesia, five countries in ASEAN - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines - decided to connect their payment systems within the year to allow people to buy goods and services throughout the region using their own currencies.The Indian central bank also said that it "had put in place a mechanism for international trade settlements in Indian rupees with immediate effect," local news outlet the Business Standard reported on July 12.In terms of population, the number of people using non-dollar payment systems could exceed 4 billion, including those from China, India, ASEAN, Russia and others, media reports said.The trend of reducing dependence on the US dollar is accelerating in the international community, Dong said.Global Times
