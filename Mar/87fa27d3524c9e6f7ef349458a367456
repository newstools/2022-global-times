They searched through those students' mobile phones and personal belongings, and refused their entry and cancelled their visa, accusing them of "hiding military training experience," Wang said.They identified training organized by Chinese colleges as "military training," Wang noted.The Chinese embassy and consulates in Australia have provided immediate consular assistance to the students, according to Wang. China will firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students in Australia, Wang noted. What Australia has done runs counter to the mutually beneficial nature of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.  China urged Australia to stop harming others and create a sound atmosphere and necessary conditions for cultural and educational exchanges and cooperation.
