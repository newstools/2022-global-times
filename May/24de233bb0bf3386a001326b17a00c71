It's natural when people suffer, they must protest," Wickremesinghe said in an interview at the colonial-era prime minister's office in Colombo."But we want to ensure that it does not destabilize the political system. With the interim budget, it is just about cutting down expenditure, cutting to the bone where possible and transferring it to welfare."The country located off India's southern tip is reeling from its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948, as a shortage of foreign currency severely curtailed imports of essentials including fuel and medicine, triggering months of unprecedented protests.Much of the public ire has been targeted at President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family, whom protesters blame for mishandling the economy.The roots of the current crisis also lie in the COVID-19 pandemic, which devastated the country's lucrative tourism industry and sapped foreign workers' remittances, and populist tax cuts enacted by the Rajapaksa administration that drained government income.Reuters
