South Korea's president will suspend informal media briefings that he has held nearly every day since taking office in May, his office said Monday, citing rising numbers of ­COVID-19 infections as a survey showed a fall in his approval ratings.The end of the free-wheeling briefings, which broke with years of tradition as President Yoon Suk-yeol sought to step up transparency, also comes amid growing questions over scandal and party turmoil.Yoon's approval ratings stood at 37 percent, pollster Realmeter's survey showed on Monday, down from more than 52 percent in the first week of June, while 57 percent now ­disapproved of his performance.In its statement, Yoon's ­office said other coverage of the president would also be limited, with spokespersons switching to mainly written comments, along with photographs and videos of his events, rather than holding in-person briefings."In view of the vulnerability to the spread of infectious diseases, we ask for your understanding," it added.Health authorities have warned the country is facing a new wave of infections, with some experts predicting hundreds of thousands of new cases in coming weeks.Monday's 12,693 new infections took South Korea's tally to 18,524,583, with 18 deaths for a toll of 24,661 since the pandemic began.After holding down infections and deaths for much of the pandemic with strict tracing, tracking and quarantine measures, the country dropped most curbs this year despite a huge wave of Omicron-variant infections.
