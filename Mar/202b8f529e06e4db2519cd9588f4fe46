Iraqi security forces stand guard near Baghdad's high-security Green Zone on October 31, 2021, after three rockets hit a neighborhood near where the US embassy is located. The so far unclaimed attack, the first to target the Green Zone since two rockets were fired on July 29, comes as authorities conduct a recount of votes cast in an October 10 parliamentary election.

Intense negotiations among political factions have since failed to forge a majority in support of a new prime minister to succeed Mustafa al-Kadhemi.AFP
