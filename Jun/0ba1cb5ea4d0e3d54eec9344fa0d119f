Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian Photo: fmprc.gov.cn  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian denied reports that China banned local media during the visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Pacific island countries, noting that media invitations are decided by the hosts.At a regular news conference on Wednesday, the spokesperson firmly denied when he was asked whether Chinese officials blocked some journalists from working during the visit. "How many media are invited and how many people are allowed to enter the site of Wang Yi's visit is decided by the host country based on factors such as practice and the size of the venue," he said. "China has fully respected the arrangements of the host country from the beginning to the end." Wang's visit was very smooth and successful, with no so-called confusion or restrictions on the media at all, Zhao said. "The media in all countries gave extensive and full coverage to the trip, which is the strongest retort to the lies," he said. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said he had heard of certain journalists trying to force their way behind Wang at the event to film. "The behavior of these journalists interfered with the order of the scene and was not in line with the professional conduct of the news media."Global Times
