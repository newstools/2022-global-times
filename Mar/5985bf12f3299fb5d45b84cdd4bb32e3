Why should we restrict them?"The combined measures are also needed, which include putting emphasis on streamlining administration and delegating power, optimizing services, while opposing monopolies and unfair competition as well as preventing the disorderly expansion of capital and unfair competition, Premier Li said.The purpose is to support enterprises operating in accordance with the law, and ensure that there is a level playing field for all entities, be they Chinese or foreign invested, and ensure that they will all have fair competition and healthy growth in a well-regulated way.China's overall economy has deeply integrated into the world economy. Imports and exports in goods account for one-third of China's GDP, while imports have contributed over 70 percent of the industrial added-value.For the past decade, China has remained the world's 2nd largest import market, and for the past five years, the largest trader in goods."I can tell you very clearly that no matter how the international environment may change, China will keep on the course of wider openness ... For anything that is conducive to our higher level of opening-up of this country, we will go for it," Li said.Analysts also rebut some media's hype of linking the push to rein in unregulated capital expansion with China's common prosperity goal, experts said.The restrictions imposed on capital of either Chinese or foreign capital are more about anti-monopoly while ensuring market competition is based on a level-playing field, Li Changan, professor of the Academy of China Open Economy Studies at the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Friday."China has been facilitating market openness which is reflected in the refining of the negative lists, with areas that used to be tight such as finance are opening wider than ever," Li Changan said.According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, in 2021, the scale of China's foreign investment reached a new high, while the scale of actual use of foreign capital in the country exceeded 1 trillion yuan （$158 billion） for the first time, reaching 1.15 trillion yuan, a jump of 14.9 percent, which was the first time in the past ten years to achieve double-digit growth.
