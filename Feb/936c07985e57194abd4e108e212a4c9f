The world's largest offshore wind farm produces its first power, Danish energy firm Orsted said on December 23, 2021, with the announcement representing a significant milestone in the facility's development.

"For a long time, everybody has been saying it's poised to take off," she said, alluding to the interest of European companies in the US offshore market. "But we had not seen the federal government take concrete action to make this a reality," she said.Currently there are just two producing offshore wind sites in the US generating a modest 42 megawatts.But the Biden administration in 2021 cleared construction of two larger offshore wind projects: Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts and South Ford Wind offshore Rhode Island.The administration also envisions reviewing at least 16 plans to construct and operate commercial offshore wind energy facilities through 2025 and plans seven auctions through 2025. Projects are expected near the coasts of North Carolina and California.In 2018, an auction on three tracts across 390,000 acres near Massachusetts raised $405 million following 32 rounds of bidding.Wednesday's bidding easily overtook that level, said Timothy Fox, an analyst at Clearview Energy Partners.While the White House's principle legislative package, "Build Back Better," remains stuck in Congress, Biden's administration "may rely on the results of the auction to reinforce his green energy bona fides," Fox said. But the auction represents just the first step in a lengthy process before wind energy will be produced.AFP
