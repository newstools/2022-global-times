Hajj pilgrims circumambulate the Kaaba, Islam's holiest site, located in the center of the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia on Friday. Hajj 2018 will commence on Sunday and will continue until August 24. More than 11,000 Chinese muslims are among the estimated 2 million muslims in Mecca and Medina for this year's Hajj.

But after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Saudi authorities announced they would only let 1,000 pilgrims take part. The following year, they increased the total to 60,000 fully vaccinated Saudi citizens and residents chosen through a lottery. Barring overseas pilgrims caused deep disappointment among Muslims worldwide, who typically save for years to take part.In April, the kingdom announced it would permit 1 million Muslims from inside and outside the country to participate in 2022's hajj, which will take place in July.AFP
