The import volume of natural gas reached 35.866 million tons, a decrease of 8.9 percent, with a value of $26.1 billion, up 59.9 percent.Experts noted that higher commodity prices have pushed up the value of imports."The decrease in the volume of energy imports was mainly due to surging prices because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has stressed the global supply chain," Han Xiaoping, chief analyst at energy industry website china5e.com, told the Global Times on Monday.COVID-19 flare-ups in China also reduced demand, experts said."Global prices may continue to stay high for a while, as geopolitical uncertainty escalates," said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University.The resulting high prices of bulk commodities could lead to more serious imported inflation this year, given the country's high external dependence on oil, iron ore, non-ferrous metals and other important commodities, Lin said.To stabilize domestic energy prices and clear away any clouds over the national economy, China's central and local governments have issued a series of measures, including increasing output, further exploring the domestic supply potential and ensuring the security of primary product supplies.In one major move, the Ministry of Finance eliminated import tariffs on coal from May 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. And the central government required coal providers to sign medium- and long-term contracts, while enhancing regulations on local prices.In March, China's raw coal output reached 395.8 million tons, up 14.8 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics."However, increasing energy supply is not a long-term solution. Authorities should seek and develop substitutes like renewable and clean energies, especially as China highly relies on crude oil imports with a 70-percent external dependence," Lin noted.
