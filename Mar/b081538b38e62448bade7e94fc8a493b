Passengers kept away from the airport as news of the attack filtered across the city, the security source said.Authorities said flights resumed soon after the incident.Domestic airlines serve Kaduna from Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos. "Security personnel have been doing their best in preventing the bandits from gaining access into the airport since last night," the security source said."The terrorists either want to storm the staff quarters and abduct people as they did in two previous cases or they aim to kidnap passengers and staff in their airport," said the source.AFP
