According to Wu, the city has been focused on the key regions including the old residential communities and urban villages.On Tuesday, the city reported 228 local COVID-19 cases and 1,259 local asymptomatic infections, with all the positive cases detected under quarantine management, Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai health commission, said at Wednesday's press briefing.Zhao has stressed the importance to stick to the dynamic zero-COVID policy and to focus on streamlined measures to win the decisive battle against the epidemic.As of Tuesday, there are 379 patients being treated in hospitals in severe conditions and 71 in critical conditions, Zhao said. The city reported seven new COVID-19-related deaths on Tuesday, the average age of the patients being 87.3. All deceased patients had preexisting conditions, according to Zhao.Zhao added that only one of the seven patients had received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and their deaths were caused by their preexisting conditions. So far eight districts and some streets in Pudong New Area have effectively curbed the virus transmission at the community level, according to health authorities.As of Tuesday, over 17.97 million residents were classified under "precaution-level," which means that they could be allowed to move freely within certain regions at certain times, according to the authorities.The authorities have also made it known that so far there are 48 designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients treatment in the city, with about 25,000 beds, including over 500 beds especially designed for children.
