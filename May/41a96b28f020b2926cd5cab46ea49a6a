Globally, the prevalence of infertility differs greatly due to its varying definition and demographical differences, ranging anywhere from 3 to 30 percent, according to the study.Qiao's team found that, in China, the prevalence of infertility among women at reproductive age increased from 11.9 percent in 2007 to 17.6 percent in 2020.The latest study was based on data from nine countries, including Nigeria, Turkey and China. The team examined 11 databases using a comprehensive search strategy to identify studies on IPV among infertile women published between database inception and September 30, 2021, according to the team.Compared with global estimates from the World Health Organization on IPV for women of reproductive age, married or in a relationship with a partner were 13 percent and 27 percent, respectively, albeit with various differences in measuring tools and subtypes of IPV, the team said that their findings showed that infertile women in LMICs could be more vulnerable to IPV than the general female population.The results indicated that a high prevalence of IPV against infertile women is evident despite heterogeneity across studies. IPV screening, counseling and structural interventions should be tailored to address this urgent issue at multiple levels of society, the team concluded.
