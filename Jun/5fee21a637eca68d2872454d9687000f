Railway departments immediately launched emergency response plans, blockaded the section, and organized personnel to repair the line, according to China Railway Chengdu Group Co.Early warnings and overall judgment of abnormal weather changes are vital, Wang Yuanfeng, a professor at the School of Civil Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, told the Global Times on Sunday.The expert called for strengthening inspections and examinations in the railway engineering system, such as installing fixed monitoring devices at high-risk areas, using drones to patrol certain segments and utilizing satellite images for judging the situations in wider ranges."Besides the use of advanced technologies, traditional human inspection should be enhanced during extreme weather, and related inspection mechanisms should be built and improved for both the railway and highway networks," Wang noted.The national flood control and drought relief authority raised its emergency response to floods to Level III on Saturday, following floods and geological disasters of varying degrees in eight southern Chinese provinces and regions due to recent heavy rains.As a result of multiple rounds of rainfall, the soil is saturated, and water at the bottom of rivers is high, which makes mountain torrents, geological disasters and small and medium-sized river floods very easy to occur. The authority requested related departments in Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces and autonomous regions to prevent and prepare for floods and deal with emergencies.

Cumulative rainfall in some areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong and six other provinces and autonomous regions can reach 100 to 200 millimeters (mm), while some can reach more than 300 mm. The NMC said some of these areas will also experience short-term heavy rainfall or strong convective weather such as thunderstorms, with rainfall of 30 to 60 mm per hour, locally exceeding 80 mmProvinces and autonomous regions including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangdong are urged to strengthen the prevention of secondary disasters.On Saturday, China's Ministry of Emergency Management vowed to strengthen monitoring and early warning systems, closely follow weather changes, launch emergency responses in a timely manner, and take preventive measures. Priority should be given to preventing geological disasters caused by mountain floods, and evacuating people in dangerous areas, said the authority. Also, it requested an enhancement of patrol and defense operations over potential river floods, and ensuring the safety of flood control work.
