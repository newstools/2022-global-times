British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Photo: VCGNew photographs of Prime Minister Boris Johnson drinking at a leaving party at his Downing Street residence have been published, reigniting opposition accusations that he breached his own COVID-19 lockdown rules.The photographs, obtained by ITV News, were taken at a gathering in honor of Downing Street's outgoing director of communications Lee Cain in November 2020, an event previously investigated by police for potential breaches of the law.Monday's photographs show Johnson making a speech and raising a toast, with half a glass in his hands, ITV said.At that time, large gatherings with people outside of their own household were banned after England had been put back into a national lockdown due to rising cases of COVID-19.Reuters could not independently verify when or where the pictures were taken. Johnson's office has said police had access to all information during their investigation, including photos.Johnson was not fined for taking part in the November 2020 event, though he was issued with a fixed penalty notice for a Downing Street gathering to mark his birthday in June 2020, an event which he said lasted no more than 10 minutes.He has apologized for what he called a mistake but refused to resign over the issue.The Metropolitan police referred to a statement announcing the end of its investigations last week when asked if it had been aware of the Cain leaving party pictures during its investigation.The Cabinet Office, which has been handling a separate government investigation into the parties, declined to comment.Reuters
