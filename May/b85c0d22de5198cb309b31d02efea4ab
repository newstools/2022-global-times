Greek LNG stations will be able to fully cover not only the national market, but also to replace a significant part of the supply of Russian gas to the Balkans," Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.He also described the terminal as a new energy gateway for Greece, the Balkans and southeastern Europe.Once completed, the terminal, which is a key part of the Alexandroupolis Independent Natural Gas System, will have an annual capacity of 5.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, according to data provided by the Greek government.Some 166.7 million euros ($176 million) out of the total 363.7 million euros allocated to the project are EU funds, according to a Greek government press release.Xinhua
