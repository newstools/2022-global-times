Aquilino claiming that China has "fully militarized" several islands in the region after personally joining an aerial reconnaissance on Sunday. Also, the US Navy sent the USS Miguel Keith expeditionary mobile base to the region for the first time on Monday.These show that the US and its military have set their eyes firmly on China despite the complex situation in other places in the world like the Ukraine tensions, and the US' provocative moves go against the recent, positive talks between the top leaders of China and the US, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times.
