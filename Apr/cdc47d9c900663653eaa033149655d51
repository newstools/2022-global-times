The company is planning to adopt a single-shift work system. SAIC Motor resumed factory production on April 18 following the guideline unveiled by local authorities earlier, and the first vehicle after the resumption completed production on April 19, the company said, noting that the completion of the 700 vehicles from brands such as Roewe will be able to meet both the domestic and export demands. Shanghai's deputy mayor Zhang Wei said on Saturday at a press conference that 70 percent of the 666 enterprises on the "whitelist" of key firms, including SAIC Motor and Tesla, have resumed work and production with an increasing production capacity. FedEx also told the Global Times on Saturday that the company will resume accepting international shipments to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on April 25 as the local situation improved. Global Times
