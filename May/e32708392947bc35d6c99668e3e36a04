In encounters with ordinary people, Wen comforts others through his work, gains warmth, and finally finds a new direction in life.The English title of the movie All Ears represents the idea of carefully listening to others, which is one of the most important parts of Wen's job. He needs to listen to others' stories of happiness, sadness or regret with patience in order to write the eulogies;and during the process, he learns to listen with his heart instead of just hisear.The cast also includes actor Wu Lei and actress Qi Xi.

The theme and story of the movie are interesting to me," goes one post on Sina Weibo among the thousands of Chinese netizens who said they are waiting for the launch of the film.Luo Luo, a Beijing-based film critic, commented on the power of realistic themes, telling the Global Times that in movies like this, the shaping of the characters is one of the most important problems and that the production team should ensure all the characters are real flesh and blood people and make their behavior logical.
