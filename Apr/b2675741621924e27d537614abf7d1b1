Zhao LijianUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Shermans criticism against China for "supporting" Russia is a cliché and old trick of throwing mud, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a routine Friday briefing, and he tugged the US to look into the mirror first before pointing finger to others.The remarks from Zhao was made in response to a question about what Sherman said at an event in Brussels on Thursday. Sherman alleged that China wasn't helping the situation in Ukraine by doing things like amplifying Russian disinformation campaigns. She said she hoped Beijing will learn the "right lessons" from Russia's war, including that it can't separate the US from its allies."They have seen what we have done in terms of sanctions, export controls, designations, vis-a-vis Russia, so it should give them some idea of the menu from which we could choose if indeed China were to provide material support," Sherman said, according to XXX.A "competitive-collaborative-adversarial" trichotomy, as China has said many times, is camouflage used by the US to target China, Zhao said. He urged the US to view China-US relations objectively, to implement the US leaders promise of not seeking a new cold war, not seeking to change Chinas system, not opposing China via strengthening relations with the US allies, and not supporting Taiwan secessionists, amongst other concerns.The US should meet China half way in seeking a coexisting form of mutual respect focused on living together and win-win solutions.He further explained that China is a builder of world peace, contributor to global development and defender of the international order. China has taken a justified and undisputable stance toward the Ukraine crisis; in contrast to the fact that the US has been badly behaved in such regards.Zhao urged the US to first look at itself in the mirror before pointing fingers at others, and mind its own business.Global Times
