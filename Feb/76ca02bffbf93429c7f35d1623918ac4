Second, there are clear criteria for selecting torchbearers for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, which require comprehensive consideration of personal will, competition results, age, popularity, ethnic composition and other factors, so as to fully reflect broad representation. The torch of the Beijing 2020 Winter Olympic Games passed through three generations of Chinese athletes at the opening ceremony, representing the continuation and inheritance of the Olympic spirit. We are glad to see that athletes from all ethnic groups, including Yilamujiang, have joined the Chinese sports team for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Zhao said.US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" on Saturday where she made irresponsible and wrong remarks about the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Xinjiang-related issues. When asked how she interpreted the fact that one of the two athletes that lit the torch was from China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Greenfield said "it is an effort by the Chinese to distract us from the real issue here at hand, that Uygurs are being tortured."China's Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun said on Saturday that Greenfield's groundless and politically-biased words have seriously poisoned China-US relations. Facing such a smear campaign, China has no choice but to push back and clarify its position and reject the unfounded accusations by the US.Global Times
