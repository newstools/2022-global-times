The case is among the latest copyright lawsuits related to the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Shanghai Pudong New Area People's Court ordered on Sunday Zhuhai-based company Haichuangxin to suspend its broadcast of content of the Beijing Winter Olympics, two days after it received a complaint from China Central Television (CCTV), the exclusive broadcaster of the event within the Chinese mainland and the Macao SAR. CCTV considers that the Zhuhai company has incurred in law infringement and unfair competition, which was agreed by the court. The judgement said that Haichuangxin's behavior, if not stopped could bring unfixable damage to the applicant.This is the latest case of infringement of the copyrights of the Beijing Winter Olympics. In the past few days, some businesses were punished for making and selling counterfeit copies of the Beijing 2022 mascot, Bing Dwen Dwen. A Beijing court proclaimed a sentence in the first case of infringement of intellectual property rights on the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic mascots on Monday as China stepped up IP protection.The China National Intellectual Property Administration also announced on Monday it will crack down on illegal use of trademarks for Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen and Chinese skier Gu Ailing.
