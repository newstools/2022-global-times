The goal of the movement is to ask the Japanese government to take action on these looted relics.To respond to the positive actions from the Japanese public, the Shanghai University held an online seminar called the "Recovery of Tang Honglu Well Stele," with the participation of scholars and the members from the association who have been engaged in the research of the Well Stele, Chen Wenping, Deputy Director of the China Overseas Cultural Relics Research Center at Shanghai University, told the Global Times on Sunday."There might be breakthroughs in tracing back the Tang Honglu Well Stele," Chen said."Assuming that a cultural relic is owned by the National Museum [of Japan], the recovering process is more troublesome as it is regarded as state-owned property which may involve amendments to relevant laws. However, considering that the Tang Honglu Well Stele was plundered and presented to the Emperor of Japan, as long as he is willing to return it, the problem would be easier to solve."As Huo Zhengxin, professor of law at the China University of Political Science and Law, noted to the Global Times, in most of the cases of tracing back relics, it is more about a "moral standard" than of regulations."No written convention at an international level requires Japan to return them. But in terms of ethics, after WW II, countries including Germany and France, have publicly formulated special regulations to return plundered relics to other countries. It is expected that the Japanese side will cooperate in this regard to meet the expectations of the people of the two countries," said Huo.Chen added that this relic is an important cultural resource of a country and mentioned that "it has extremely high historical value and counted as national treasure.""It is unacceptable for such a precious cultural relic, plundered by Japan, is now kept in the imperial palace and the Chinese cannot even see it," Chen said, adding that "China has every reason to demand Japan to return the Tang Honglu Well Stele."In fact, scholars from China have been asking the Japanese government to return the Tang Honglu Well Stele for years. Tong Zeng, President of the China Federation of Civil Claims against Japan (CFCC), told the global Times on Sunday that they submitted the first requests to the Japanese government as early as 2014. However, no substantial results have been seen.In 2019, Tong wrote a letter to the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan, but "no response has been received."

Tong added.The seminar held by the Shanghai University mainly focuses on the research of the Tang Honglu Well Stele, as well as the discussion over the future of Chinese-Japanese cultural cooperation.
