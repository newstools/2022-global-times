State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi  The Taiwan question is at the core of China's core interests and the one-China principle is the mainstay of stabilizing the Taiwan Straits, emphasized Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday at ASEAN Secretariat, when asked about the root cause of the current tension across the Taiwan Straits.Wang clarified by saying that the essence of the status quo  is that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one China and that China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity have never been divided despite the long-standing political confrontation across the Straits."The status quo has never and will not change. It is exactly the island's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities and some external forces who are challenging and trying to change the status quo," Wang noted.The situation across the Taiwan Straits depends on whether the one-China principle is fully recognized and earnestly followed, said Wang, pointing out that the underlying cause of the current tension is that the island's DPP authorities have abandoned the one-China principle embodied by the 1992 Consensus.At the same time, the US is trying to twist and hollow out the one-China principle to contain China's development, said Wang, urging once more the US to preserve China's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan region."The US has recently said many times that it will protect every country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We approve of such position and hope the US will keep their word, avoiding double standards" Wang noted.
