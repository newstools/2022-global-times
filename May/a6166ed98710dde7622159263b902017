The official Palestinian news agency Wafa identified the dead teenager as Amjad al-Fayed.A hub of armed Palestinian groups, the Jenin area in the northern West Bank has been repeatedly raided by Israeli forces since a wave of anti-Israeli attacks in late March. Many of the perpetrators came from there.The Israeli army said that during "operational activity" near Kafr Dan, a village northwest of Jenin, "a number of suspects shot live fire at... soldiers from a passing vehicle."The suspects also hurled Molotov cocktails and an explosive device toward the soldiers," it said. "The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects. Hits were identified."The Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed Fayed as a member and a "son," praising him in a statement for confronting the Israeli soldiers with gunfire and explosive devices. The Israeli forces "were exposed and confronted with valor by our battalion's" fighters, Islamic Jihad said in a statement, "and thwarted their insidious scheme."At Fayed's funeral in the Jenin refugee camp, armed members of the militant group carried his coffin.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh condemned Fayed's killing, stressing in remarks relayed by Wafa that "the international community should hold Israel accountable for its acts."The Jenin-area operations to track down suspects, and clashes with Palestinians, have often turned deadly for both sides.Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American, died when she was shot in the head near the Jenin refugee camp on May 11 while covering an Israeli raid.In other overnight operations at a variety of locations throughout the West Bank, Israeli forces arrested nine Palestinian suspects and confiscated weapons as part of "counter-terrorism activities," the army said in a Saturday statement.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and controls all entry points to the territory.About 475,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law, alongside 2.9 million Palestinians.A wave of anti-Israel attacks since March 22 in Israel left 18 people, mostly Israeli civilians, killed by several Palestinian and Israeli Arab attackers, some of whom died in the violence.AFP
