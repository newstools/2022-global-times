This type of aircraft has been a frequent participant in the PLA's patrols and drills near the island of Taiwan.The PLA's commissioning of more advanced fighter jets like the J-16 will eventually replace older fighter jets like the J-7 and the J-8, and contribute to the combat capability of the PLA, analysts said.Even if a cross-Straits military conflict breaks out, the PLA will only target secessionists, not ordinary people, the expert said, noting that Taiwan's defense authority has an evil intent by issuing the handbook, as it is attempting to hype the "threat" of the mainland.
