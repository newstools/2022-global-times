Beijing has started three additional rounds of mass nucleic acid testing in 12 districts from Friday to Sunday, as the Chinese capital races against time to contain the latest resurgence of COVID-19 infections. Photo:XinhuaThe first clinic research of China's antiviral oral drug against SARS-CoV-2, VV116, was published on Tuesday. The study shows the drug can effectively treat patients infected with the Omicron variant with mild symptoms in early stages.The study was conducted in March this year and included 136 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 60 in the VV116 group and 76 in the control group. And the results show that the VV116 group spent on average 8.56 days to test negative for COVID-19, whilst the time for the control group stood at 11.13 days.No adverse reactions were observed within those who took VV116, the study shows.The paper was published on Taylor & Francis Group, an international company that publishes books and academic journals, by scientists from Fudan University's Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and other institutes. Zhang Wenhong, head of the infectious disease department at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, and also head of the National Center for Infectious Disease under the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, co-authored the article.Since the article only included patients with mild symptoms, it doesn't have enough data to show the drug's effect on patients with severe symptoms, the study pointed out.According to industrial analysis, there were recently 21 domestic COVID-19 drugs under research and development in China, among them six had reached phase III clinical trials.The VV116, an oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleoside candidate jointly developed by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is one of the most focused candidates. VV116 has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in Uzbekistan and is being investigated in several Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with COVID-19.China previously gave green light to Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment drug Paxlovid and it is already being used to treat some of the country's COVID-19 patients. Chinese researchers are also conducting clinical studies to compare the effects of Paxlovid and VV116.
