Activists hold placards in protest at the impending execution of Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, sentenced to death for trafficking heroin into Singapore but diagnosed as intellectually disabled, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Wednesday. They said the execution of Nagaenthran would be a violation not only of international treaties but also of the Singapore constitution.

It was not immediately clear when the execution would be carried out.Reuters
