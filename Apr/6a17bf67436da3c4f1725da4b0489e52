That the Fed might hike interest rates at a much quicker pace also makes the case for the PBC to take a small step toward reserve requirement cuts, Tian Yun, a Beijing-based economist, told the Global Times on Friday.The consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, rose by 1.5 percent in March, official data showed. The reading, conspicuously higher than its January-February versions, mostly driven by oil price surges, is considered to have flagged the need for a more calibrated approach to monetary easing. Liquidity is within a reasonable and ample range, the central bank said, revealing that Friday's announcement would lower financial institutions' funding costs by about 6.5 billion yuan per annum.The central bank vowed to continue a prudent monetary policy, with a keen eye on price level moves and monetary policy changes in major developed economies.It's possible that the PBC may take yet another small step of 25 basis points in RRR cuts after the Fed decides on its next rate hike in May, Tian said. There were also reports on Friday that the market interest rate pricing self-regulation mechanism recently held a meeting at which small- and medium-sized banks were encouraged to lower the upper limit of the floating band of deposit rates by about 10 basis points. Such a move could lower the costs for banks, Lian said, but that it would have a limited impact on banks' loan extensions.While the near-term leeway for more aggressive monetary easing seems less likely, hopes are high that the country's fiscal coffer, with sufficient ammunitions that according to Tian amount to 10 trillion yuan, not including unused surplus from last year, would be tapped into in a more robust manner to ensure stable growth.The National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top planning agency, announced plans to ramp up infrastructure investment to bolster economic growth.  With vibrant trade growth underpinning economic growth for the first quarter, an expansion of around 4.5 percent seems most likely during the first quarter, according to Tian, citing the virus situation in Shanghai causing a 0.5 percentage point cut from his previous projection.If the virus flare-ups in Shanghai can be controlled in the first half of the year, it's likely that consumption might rebound beginning the third quarter thereby offsetting a possibly shrinking trade landscape in the second half amid Fed rate hike-fueled sluggish external demand, he said.
