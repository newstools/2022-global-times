It's not a nice result," she said, according to footage released by the palace on Sunday.The unit at the Royal London Hospital was built in record time to cope with an influx of COVID-19 sufferers. The construction team hailed the "Dunkirk spirit" that inspired them, referring to the World War II retreat of British and allied forces from northern France, in the face of a Nazi onslaught."Thank goodness it still exists," the queen replied. "It is very interesting, isn't it, when there is some very vital thing, how everybody works together and pulls together - marvelous, isn't it?"Fears for the queen's health have lingered since she had an unscheduled overnight stay in hospital in October 2021, which was only revealed by the palace later.Her public appearances have become rarer since, and she has complained of mobility problems, as her 96th birthday approaches on April 21.AFP
