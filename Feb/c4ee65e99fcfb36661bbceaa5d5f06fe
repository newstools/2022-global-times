Algeria's state-run energy giant Sonatrach said Monday that it is ready to boost gas supplies to Europe that may face a potential decline in Russian gas imports amid the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict.The CEO of Sonatrach Toufik Hakkar said in an interview with the local Liberte newspaper that the trans-Mediterranean (Transmed) natural gas pipeline linking Algeria and Italy has a spare capacity that can be used to increase supply to Europe.Hakkar added that the European gas market is evolving within difficult geopolitical developments amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.He noted that "Sonatrach is and will remain a reliable partner and supplier of gas for the European market and is constantly available and ready to support its long-term partners in the event of a difficult situation."Sonatrach assures currently 11 percent of Europe's gas imports via Transmed pipeline, said Hakkar.
