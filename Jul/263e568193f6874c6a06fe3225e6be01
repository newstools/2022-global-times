Borders with Mali will reopen and regional diplomats will return to Bamako. "However, the heads of state decided to maintain individual sanctions, and the suspension of Mali from ECOWAS, until the return to constitutional rule," Kassi Brou said.The individual sanctions targeted members of the ruling junta and the transitional council.Mali has defaulted on over $300 million of its debt due to the sanctions, which cut it off from the regional financial market and the regional central bank.The West African leaders meeting in Accra also accepted a pledge from the junta that seized power in Burkina Faso in January to restore constitutional order in 24 months.Kassi Brou said that after a lengthy discussion with the coup leaders, a new proposal for a 24-month transition was more acceptable.Reuters
