Gaymon, who came from South Carolina to join the packed crowd, told Xinhua that she thinks the income gap in the country has been widening in recent years."It seems like there's all tax breaks for the rich and everything is more expensive and nothing's being done to help those that are struggling," Gaymon said. "I just think that the country is going backwards."According to the website of the Poor People's Campaign, while the US economy has grown 18-fold in the past 50 years, wealth inequality has expanded, the costs of living have increased, and social programs have been cut dramatically."The truth is that the millions of poor people in the United States today are poor because the wealth and resources of our country have been flowing to a small number of people and federal programs are not meeting the growing needs of the poor," the campaign noted."For those who say we have a deficit of resources, I say absolutely not. The deficit is in the human will," Bernice King, the youngest child of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, told the rally, urging an "immediate abolition of poverty."Xinhua
