But countries will now transition toward giving half of their WHO contributions as straightforward membership fees instead, giving the organization more flexibility.Tedros, who was reelected earlier Tuesday, has made overhauling the agency's finances a key plank of his leadership. He had warned countries that it was "now or never," after the COVID-19 crisis exposed the shortcomings of the existing setup."The pandemic has demonstrated why the world needs WHO, but also why the world needs a stronger, empowered and sustainably financed WHO," Tedros told the assembly.The WHO gets its money from its 194 member states and nongovernmental organizations.Nations' membership fees - "assessed contributions" calculated according to wealth and population - account for less than one-fifth of the WHO's funding.Most of it currently comes via "voluntary contributions" from member states and donors, which go toward outcomes specified by them.The WHO therefore has limited leeway to respond to crises like COVID-19, the Ukraine crisis and other health emergencies.The membership fee portion will rise to 50 percent by the 2030-31 budget cycle at the latest.In return, the WHO will be expected to implement reforms, including towards more transparency on its financing and hiring.Changing the funding model will help the WHO implement its priorities "more effectively and efficiently," Tedros said Tuesday.Rather than spending time scrambling to find money, "you're telling us to focus on the programs, and the funding will be taken care of."AFP
