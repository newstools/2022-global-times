About 100 demonstration parks will be built for tackling environmental pollution.To achieve the goals, the government will strengthen financial support with measures such as including the eligible projects into the scope of local government special bond support.Experts applauded the latest notice, noting that specifying the targets for urban environmental management is an indication of China's capability, especially in finance, that supports such an upgrade.China's management of the urban environment has been consistent, especially in the past decade, with various policies being put in place, and the latest notice will raise the targets to a new level, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Wednesday."The threshold for urban environmental governance has now been raised, which is also a reflection of the country's rising financial ability that supports such an upgrade," Lin said.
