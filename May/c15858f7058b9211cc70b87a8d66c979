Local governments will also actively follow up on policies to support enterprises' reasonable financing needs and optimize the supervision of pre-sale funds.Xuzhou announced a series of policies, including cutting interest rates on mortgages and encouraging financial institutions to reduce the down payment ratio for first-time buyers.The local government is striving to help developers by increasing support for project loans and M&A loans, and actively extending and renewing loans to troubled enterprises to relieve their capital pressure.Meizhou, Lianyungang and Yueyang also announced support measures. Meizhou reduced the down payment ratio for the housing provident fund for second-time home buyers to 20 percent, while Lianyungang confirmed that the down payment ratio for first homes stood at 20 percent.Yueyang said that buyers who purchase their first homes in the urban area and complete the deed tax payment will receive 10,000 yuan ($1,511) of subsidies each.Ganzhou, East China's Jiangxi, raised the maximum amount of housing provident fund loans to 600,000 yuan, and the age of home buyers was extended to 70 years."The moves reflected localities' urgency and initiative to boost the property market, especially during the golden week of property sales," Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday.However, data from the China Index Academy showed that during the five-day holidays, the new commercial residential transaction area in key cities fell 52.3 percent year-on-year, reflecting shrinking demand due to the new wave of the epidemic.Yan noted that all these central and local government moves will contribute to boosting the real estate market in May, suggesting that the authorities closely track the market situation, accelerate the release of supporting measures and lift restrictive policies.
