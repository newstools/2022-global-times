According to the negotiator, the future of Crimea, certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk should be decided only by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia.He called on Ukraine's partners to provide air defense systems, give weapons to "adequately help" Kiev, adding that sanctions, such as oil embargoes and restrictions on financial transactions, are also needed.Earlier in March, Podolyak said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, may hold talks soon. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that it is too early to talk about a meeting between the two presidents, as there is no breakthrough yet.Ukrainian and Russian delegations held three rounds of peace talks in-person in Belarus since February 28, and the fourth one started on March 14 in a video conference format.Xinhua
