I believe that the market demand for watching films may rebound before the filmmaking industry itself," Xiang noted. The box office of Jurassic World: Dominion crossed 40 million yuan on Sunday, and the domestic romance film One Week Friend ranked second with 11.17 million yuan of box office sales as of press time.Jurassic World: Dominion hit the cinemas in the Chinese mainland on June 10, bringing the nation's daily box office back up to 100 million yuan for the first time in 103 days.It also topped the first-day box office record list for imported films in 2022 with 95.25 million yuan.Xiang pointed out that the lack of films is a challenge for the recovery of the film industry, noting that the summer film season might be a good opportunity for film makers to make up for losses seen during previous holidays due to the epidemic. The surge in the box office comes as major Chinese cities recover from recent COVID-19 outbreaks, with more cinemas reopening. Cinemas in Beijing have been reopening at 75 percent capacity since June 6, with some smaller venues still temporarily closed.
