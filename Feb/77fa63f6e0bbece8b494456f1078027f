Should a settlement not be reached, the EU may launch a formal dispute, requiring a WTO panel to study the case."Whether the case could be settled through negotiations will depend more on political factors, instead of technical discussion," Li said.Commenting on the EU's accusation, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in January vehemently denied the allegation, saying that the so-called coercion against Lithuania is completely false, and the issue between China and Lithuania is political rather than economic, and it was created because of the latter's treachery that hurts China's interests.Global Times
