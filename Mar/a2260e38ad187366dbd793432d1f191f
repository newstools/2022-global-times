Antigen detection product Photo: VCGChinese antigen test kit industry insiders said on Monday that the domestic antigen test kits' production capacity is now fully secured with an adequate supply available at a reasonable price, temporarily ending the shortage only two weeks after antigen test kits were first approved for domestic sales.Despite surging domestic demand, producers are working around the clock to deliver the much-needed test kits for both domestic and overseas buyers, supply is getting well-balanced with demand, with production expansion and government coordination, the industry insiders said.As of Monday, more than 14 million people have been tested for antigens in Shanghai, according to media reports, indicating a huge demand. Nucleic acid tests were carried out immediately after some people with positive antigen tests were found.Hangzhou Alltest Biotech Co, one of the domestically approved antigen test kit suppliers based in East China's Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times on Monday that the current demand is huge and the company is mulling expansion of production in accordance with market needs.The Hangzhou-based company said that since it has been approved for domestic sales of antigen test kits, it has so far delivered tens of millions of the kits for the domestic market alone.On March 11, the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism against COVID-19 decided to add antigen testing as a supplement to nucleic acid testing. Residents who have self-test needs can then purchase antigen test kits through retail pharmacies, online sales platforms and other channels.So far, the National Medical Products Administration has approved 19 Chinese antigen test kit producers for domestic sales. The current total production capacity of the antigen test kit makers combined is fully capable to meet the market demand, Bai Yu, president of the Medical Appliances Branch of the China Medical Pharmaceutical Material Association, told the Global Times on Monday, pointing to the complete domestic supply chain and the swift governmental and industrial response."Since the full supply chain is based in China, it won't be a problem for these companies to provide timely antigen kits for domestic needs," Bai said.The production capacity of the industry skyrocketed by about 100 times within about two weeks, with adequate supply for both home and abroad, according to Bai.Moreover, all antigen test kit makers are working in full swing for market supply, and almost all clients can get spot goods with no need to wait, the Global Times learned.Several online drug stores that the Global Times reached on Monday also said that they are no longer setting purchase limits for antigen test kits as the supply is becoming adequate.With more supplies and government efforts in place, the prices of antigen test kits are also expected to drop significantly.The current market retail price in some cities is uneven, with an average of around 25 yuan, but the current provincial-level procurement price is between 7.9-9.8 yuan, Bai said.But now local governments are tackling high prices by introducing the first-ever market pricing standard for the corresponding industry players and medical institutions to follow.For example, a joint notice for the price-setting of antigen test kits was released on Monday by Beijing Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau together with other government departments, and it stipulated that the total cost of antigen testing shall not exceed 11.37 yuan per time.The notice also requested medical institutions not to charge fees for outpatient medical services for simple antigen testing.
