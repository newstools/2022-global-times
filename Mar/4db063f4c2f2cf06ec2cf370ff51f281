The National Grain Trade Center organized an imported soybean auction, which clinched a deal for 256,000 tons."It is expected that similar policies will continue, which will effectively increase domestic soybean supply," Wang said.In addition, with more policy support to encourage sowing, it is estimated that China's soybean planting area will increase by more than 20 million mu (1.33 million hectares) in 2022 from last year and exceed the 2020 level, given normal weather conditions, Wang noted.With a self-sufficiency rate of less than 20 percent, soybeans are one of the few grains for which China relies heavily on imports. Major sources of imports are the US, Brazil and Argentina.Whether China will increase soybean imports depends on domestic supply and demand and international prices, Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of cngrain.com, told the Global Times on Thursday."Since the tension between Russia and Ukraine has caused sharp rises in international grain prices and weakened the advantage of imported grain, it is not a good time to sign new trade orders at this stage," Jiao said."If the situation eases and international food prices fall and cost-performance advantages return, imports of corn, soybeans and other grains are likely to increase," he said.In 2021, China imported more than 90 million tons of soybeans, and the volume in 2020 reached over 100 million tons, customs data showed.
