Other independent testing locations will also be arranged for other students who are considered high-risk for COVID-19, the institute said.Data showed that from 2018 to 2021, some 15,000 to 17,000 students in Tianjin have chosen to take the spring gaokao. The exam is for secondary vocational students and high school students to go for college. Examinees enjoy the same treatment in universities or colleges as students who were enrolled through national gaokao.The spring gaokao in Tianjin was postponed to June 12 due to the recent COVID-19 resurgence in Tianjin.A total of 57 cases have been reported in Tianjin in the past four days since May 15. The daily new positive cases recorded on Thursday were 33, municipal health commission reported.
