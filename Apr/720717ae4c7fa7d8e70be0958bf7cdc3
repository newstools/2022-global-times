In an interview with the media, Zhong said she was not alarmed by the sudden arrival of the epidemic, because she believed that the Shenzhen government would guarantee the timely supply of daily necessities. At the same time, the dozens of plants she had planted at home could guarantee at least half a month's supply for her family.Zhong said her plan to grow fruits and vegetables on a balcony began in the spring of 2020 when she was home in quarantine for two months because of the epidemic. The urge to eat fresh fruits and vegetables and the dull boredom at home made her to device the plan. Later, she set up several WeChat groups for netizens to exchange their experience of growing vegetables and fruits. Currently, this trend is also gradually becoming a new way for people living in the city to be self-sufficient during the epidemic in China.
