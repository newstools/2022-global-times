The EU's health and medicine agencies said Monday they were recommending a second ­booster shot of a COVID-19 vaccine for people over 60 years old, as infections rise again."With cases and hospitalizations rising again as we enter the summer period, I urge everybody to get vaccinated and boosted as quickly as possible," Stella Kyriakides, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said."There is no time to lose," she added in a statement issued by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency.The agencies had already recommended a second booster, or a fourth dose, for people over the age of 80, since April 2022."I call on member states to rollout second boosters for everyone over the age of 60 as well as all vulnerable persons immediately," Kyriakides ­added.ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said there was "an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries," driven mainly by the Omicron subvariant BA.5 of the coronavirus."This signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union. There are still too many individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible," Ammon added.However, the agencies also said at the moment there was no need to give out a second booster "to people below 60 years of age who are not at higher risk severe disease," or those working in healthcare or in care homes.According to World Health Organization data, COVID-19 cases have been rising sharply since the end of May around most of Europe.
