We will even have private screenings at 10 am and 1 pm on Friday," a staffer told the Global Times on Thursday.Shanghai Wanda Cinema has also kicked off pre-sales of tickets, offering Dolby Cinema and IMAX experiences.

For example, at Shanghai Wanda Cinema, the audience will be limited to less than 50 percent of capacity, and moviegoers will have their temperature measured, wear masks and enter the theater only with negative nucleic acid testing results within 72 hours.In addition, Shanghai Wanda Cinema will require all staff members with direct contact to audiences to take nucleic acid tests on daily basis and will remind viewers to wear masks and not eat and drink during the film screening.The gradual resumption of cinemas in Shanghai will give a boost to the national film market as life returns to normalcy and will usher in a comprehensive recovery in the services sector, Hong Yong, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday.Shanghai has been a mainstay of the nation's film industry.

"With the resumption of cinemas in Shanghai, it is expected that China's box office during the summer vacation will surpass the level of last year to exceed 10 billion yuan," Xiang said.However, cinemas will remain closed in some parts of the city. The city's culture and tourism bureau said on Wednesday that given the current epidemic situation, it will allow entertainment venues to gradually reopen depending on the epidemic situation in each district in a strict and orderly manner."Due to the recent resurgence in COVID cases in the city we will adjust operations according to the notice of the superior department," a cinema in Jiading district told the Global Times on Thursday.Tianshan Cinema in Changning district said in a notice that the originally scheduled resumption on Friday will be suspended due to epidemic controls. "Due to the recent increase of COVID-19 cases in Shanghai, it is expected that measures to enter cinemas will be more elaborate and strict in the future," Xiang noted.Shanghai reported 32 new local COVID19 cases and 22 asymptomatic cases for July 6.
