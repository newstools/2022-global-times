Foreign media speculated it has the hull number 106.Another report by China Central Television (CCTV) on Tuesday made coverage on a series of realistic combat drills by a destroyer detachment attached to the PLA Eastern Theater Command Navy, and the exercises reportedly featured warships including the Ningbo, the Shaoxing and the Taiyuan.This is also the first time the Shaoxing has been featured in an official report as participating in an exercise, and the CCTV report shows that it is a Type 052D destroyer with the hull number 134.The drills practiced anti-ship, air defense, maritime replenishment and coordinated maneuvering, the report said.China has built many advanced warships like the Type 052D destroyer, the Type 055 large destroyer and the Type 075 amphibious assault ships over the past few years. And based on the general pattern of ship construction, it is likely for a number of them to now join the PLA naval service, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday.With more main battle vessels entering service, the PLA Navy's capabilities to safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests are growing as well, the expert said, noting that China is aiming to build a blue-water navy capable of not only coastal defense but also far sea escort.The PLA Navy could give a glimpse on more newly commissioned vessels as it celebrates its 73rd founding anniversary on Saturday, the Global Times learned.
