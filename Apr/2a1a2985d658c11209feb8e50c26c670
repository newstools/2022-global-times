Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the country's coal output increased 14.8 percent year-on-year to 396 million tons last month, with daily production at 12.77 million tons.Due to fast growth in domestic supply, the country's coal imports stood at 16.42 million tons in March, plunging 39.9 percent year-on-year, according to the NBS."The authorities are expected to come up with more measures to stabilize coal prices, like increasing production capacity," Guan said, noting that coal prices may keep falling for the rest of 2022.
