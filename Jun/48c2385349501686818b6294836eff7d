China urges the US to fulfill President Joe Biden's statement with real actions that the US does not support "Taiwan independence," Zhao Lijian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a press conference on Monday in response to the US' move of adding back the statement "We do not support Taiwan independence" in its State Department fact sheet.The US State Department has changed its fact sheet again over the island of Taiwan, adding back the statement "We do not support Taiwan independence," it was found in the US State Department website on May 28, after it removed the line less than a month earlier."History can't be tampered with, facts can't be denied, and right and wrong can't be distorted," Zhao said."There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China," Zhao said.The one-China principle is the consensus of the international community and a universally recognized basic norm governing international relations, and also a solemn commitment made by the US to China in the three China-US joint communiques, Zhao noted.The US should abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations in the three China-US joint communiques, follow through on the political commitments on the Taiwan question it made to China, and fulfill President Biden's statement that the US does not support "Taiwan independence," Zhao said. "The US should stop engaging in political manipulation of Taiwan-related issues or containing China with the Taiwan question," Zhao said. Otherwise, it will seriously damage China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, he added.
