The carrier said the digital yuan payment covers ticket purchase and on-site check-in services.Chinese digital services platform Meituan said on Wednesday that the digital yuan payment channel will be open for all offline consumption scenarios on the platform, and users can pay via digital yuan and receive exclusive consumption subsidies when purchasing fresh food, taking a taxi or watching movies.Since January this year, nearly 90 percent of the digital yuan payment in Meituan has flowed to daily consumption settings such as take-out, grocery shopping, and catering. Among them, small transaction orders below 30 yuan accounted for the highest proportion, Meituan told the Global Times on Saturday.Similarly, Tencent-owned WeChat, one of the leading payment services providers, also began supporting the digital yuan on January 6 via its WeChat Pay mobile wallet.Data from Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration on Friday showed that by the end of 2021, Beijing has opened more than 12 million digital yuan wallets for individuals, covering more than 400,000 Winter Olympic scenarios such as food, housing, transportation, travel, shopping, entertainment, and medical care, and the transaction amount reached 9.6 billion yuan.Market insiders have claimed that the Winter Olympics will be an opportunity for the full on promotion of the digital yuan. A research report released by Guotai Juan Securities said that the pilot of different digital yuan settings will focus on the areas within the security red line of the Winter Olympics, with the main goal of ensuring and facilitating the payment choices for domestic and foreign consumers. Essence Securities predicted that calculated from the infrastructure and system transformation of commercial banks, the entire digital yuan transformation is expected to drive a total investment scale of 116.5 billion yuan.
