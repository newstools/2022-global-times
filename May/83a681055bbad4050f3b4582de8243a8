In early May, the kingdom announced that economic growth in the first quarter had risen 9.6 percent compared to the same period in 2021, which the statistics authority said represented "the highest growth rate in [the] last 10 years."It has resisted US entreaties to raise oil output in an attempt to bring prices down in the wake of the Ukraine conflict, instead stressing its commitment to the OPEC+ oil alliance, which Riyadh and Moscow lead.Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said earlier in May that the country expected to ramp up its daily oil production capacity by more than 1 million barrels to exceed 13 million barrels by 2027.Yet in 2021, Saudi Arabia pledged ahead of the COP26 climate change summit to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060, sparking skepticism from environmental campaign group Greenpeace. With increasing urgency to limit global warming, experts warn of the need to reduce fossil fuel use. AFP
