The lands in these villages were confiscated for establishing more settlements.In Gaza, masses of participants were scheduled to mark the anniversary on the border between eastern Gaza and Israel. However, the rally's organizers decided to hold it at the fishermen's harbor in the western part of Gaza city.Thousands from all over the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave arrived at the harbor in western Gaza city, waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans supporting the legitimate Palestinian cause.In their addresses to the participants, speakers of the Palestinian factions stressed the need for ending the internal division and restoring unity to confront Israel and end its occupation of the Palestinian territories.Four years ago, tens of thousands of Palestinians participated in a massive rally on the border between the eastern Gaza and Israel and launched the Marches of Return and Breaking the Israeli Siege.Xinhua
