Afghan Assets $ US Aid Illustration: Liu Rui/GT As the initiator of the Afghan issues, the US should make up for the Afghan people for the devastation they suffered with concrete moves, the Chinese representative to the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Council said on Thursday. It has been 10 months since the situation in Afghanistan changed dramatically and the interim government has made some progress but still faces multiple challenges on humanitarian, economics, security and other fields, the Chinese representative said.The representative said that the international community should strengthen communication with the Afghan interim government to help it build an inclusive political system and adopt moderate internal and foreign policies and to fight against all kinds of terrorism and live peacefully with other countries. Moreover, the international community should also offer necessary urgent humanitarian anti-virus assistance to Afghanistan to help ease livelihood problems.The Chinese representative said that the US is the initiator of the Afghan issues. Innocent civilians were killed by US soldiers or in the wars the US started, with hundreds of thousands more becoming refugees.The irresponsible withdrawal of the US from Afghanistan has led to the current severe humanitarian crisis. However, instead of helping the Afghan people, the US wantonly robbed the Afghan people's assets, aggravating their pain, said the Chinese representative. China urges the US to fully lift the unilateral sanctions on Afghanistan, returning Afghan people's assets unconditionally and make up for the devastation the US has brought on the Afghan people with concrete moves, said the Chinese representative.Global Times
