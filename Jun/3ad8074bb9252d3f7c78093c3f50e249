French President Emmanuel Macron (left) looks on as he leaves a polling station after casting his vote in the second stage of French parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, northern France on June 19, 2022. One month on from Macron's reelection as French president, he is hoping to hold onto his majority in parliament but faces a new super coalition on the left.

Wade" ruling that guaranteed US abortion rights and several conservative states immediately announced they would ban abortion.France was one of several US allies to condemn the decision, with President Emmanuel Macron denouncing a threat to women's freedom.The leader of Macron's party in parliament on Saturday said she had tabled a bill to "enshrine the respect for abortion in our constitution" amid the rise of the far-right National Rally, a party she described as "fierce opponents" of abortion."Women's rights are always fragile rights that are regularly threatened," Aurore Berge told the France Inter radio station.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said the government would support the bill "wholeheartedly," echoing the support expressed by other ministers."For all women, for human rights, we must set this gain in stone. Parliament must be able to unite overwhelmingly over this text," she wrote on Twitter.Leading politicians from left-wing parties welcomed the government's "U-turn" in a statement and invited like-minded parliamentary groups to submit a joint text.The left-wing NUPES alliance and Macron's Ensemble coalition would together command a large majority in favor of such a constitutional change.Macron is seeking parliamentary allies to pass reforms after his formation lost its majority in legislative elections earlier in June.The National Rally has long been opposed to abortion, but current leader Marine le Pen has since presented herself as a defender of women's rights and backed the status quo.Party spokesperson Philippe Ballard told FranceInfo radio that Le Pen had never called into question France's existing abortion laws.Asked about the US Supreme Court's ruling, he said: "We're not going to get involved in other people's affairs."But the president of the party, Jordan Bardella, said the government's initiative was a "diversion" from more pressing issues."Where are the emergency plans for purchasing power and against immigration?" he said in a statement.Fabien di Filippo, a deputy with the right-wing Republicans party, took a similar view."Legislative time is limited," he said. "Let's not lose sight of the economic and social emergency in our country."Bruno Retailleau, leader of the party's group in the Senate, said: "To hide its incapacity to sort out the country's real problems, the majority is inventing fictional ones."AFP
