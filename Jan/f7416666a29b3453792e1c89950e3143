It has also been advising locals not to leave the country for non-essential reasons. The administration has been making dynamic adjustments according to the situation of the pandemic, and has asked all levels of immigration departments to offer differentiated solutions for each case and to avoid oversimplifying matters, said Chen Jie, spokesperson for the administration. "For those applying to go abroad for study, employment, business and other specific needs, and for those coming to China for trade, science and technology events and urgent humanitarian reasons, the immigration agencies will issue entry and exit documents in time after examining their applications," Chen said. The immigration agencies will give priority to Chinese citizens leaving and entering the country to attend international epidemic prevention events as well as to resume work and production, he added. The administration will continue to facilitate visa application and living permits for foreigners in China, helping to build a healthy, safe and orderly environment for the movement of people between China and overseas. Chen stressed that the virus import situation is still serious, with an accelerated spread of new variants. He called on personnel with immigration needs to follow relevant rules and reduce non-urgent trips, as well as to value the achievements that China has made so far in fighting the pandemic.
