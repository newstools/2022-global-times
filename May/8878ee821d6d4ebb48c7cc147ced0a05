Photo: VCGThe spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK on Tuesday criticized some UK politicians for smearing China over so-called human rights issues in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, noting that they have no qualifications or rights to make irresponsible remarks and issue orders to the Chinese government and the United Nations (UN).The statement was released as UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss gave a statement on the same day accusing "human rights violations" in China's Xinjiang, citing so-called new evidence.The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on Tuesday also released some alleged secret documents about "internment camps" for ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.In response, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK slammed the BBC on Twitter on Tuesday, saying that it is a "shame for the BBC to carry the fabricated story about so-called 'detention camps.' Pathetic for the media, in cahoots with the notorious rumormonger, to once again spread disinformation about Xinjiang. Your smearing campaign will never obstruct China from making progress!"The so-called new evidence was just another lie of anti-China activists and an ugly act of a small group of anti-China elements that colluded with anti-China activists to sabotage the visit to China of the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, from May 23 to 28, at the invitation of the Chinese government.UK politicians have repeatedly echoed rumors spread by anti-China activists and groundlessly slandered China's Xinjiang policy. What is their motive? The answer is nothing more than grandstanding and eye-catching, nothing more than diverting the public's attention and covering up the UK's disgraceful human rights record, the spokesperson noted.A large number of facts have proved that China's Xinjiang is in a great period of economic development, social stability, improvement of people's livelihood and ethnic unity. The accusation of "massive human rights violations" in Xinjiang is completely malicious slander, the spokesperson said, noting that the Chinese government's policy on Xinjiang has been wholeheartedly supported by people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region and fully affirmed by the international community.We would like to warn some UK politicians that their slander and smearing will only further expose their vicious intentions to undermine China's national unity and obstruct China's stable development, which will make Chinese people, of all ethnic groups in the country, unite more closely and smash all interference and sabotaging activities by anti-China forces, the spokesperson said.What UK politicians should do is reflect on their own massive human rights violations, earnestly abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and stop interfering in other countries' domestic affairs, the spokesperson said.
