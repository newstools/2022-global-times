Without a decisive strategy, it risks new dependencies on unsustainable suppliers," said lead author Liesbet Gregoir. If, on the other hand, it wants to become less reliant on external sources, Europe will need to open new mineral ore mines and refineries.There is "theoretical potential" for new mines to provide between 5 and 55 percent of the continent's raw metal needs, the report said. But projects need to get going now if they are to be operational in time.Meanwhile, investments in refining are being stymied by Europe's energy crisis and soaring fuel prices.The study concludes that "recycling is Europe's best chance to improve its long-term self-sufficiency," noting metals recycling produces significantly less carbon dioxide than primary metals production.AFP
