They identified him as Diaa Hamarshah."We unfortunately have to note that five people have died," said Eli Bin, head of the Magen David Adom emergency responders, revising upward a death toll of two from shootings in two locations in Bnei Brak.Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, issued a rare condemnation of the attacks."The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation, while we are all striving for stability," Abbas said in a statement.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads an ideologically disparate coalition government ranging from Jewish nationalists to Arabs, said the country was "facing a wave of murderous... terrorism."US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Tuesday's "terrorist attack," calling the recent spate of violence "unacceptable."Police were deployed in large numbers in Bnei Brak late in the evening, AFP journalists at the scene said. AFP
