The consumption of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon emissions in China, accounting for about 88 percent of all carbon emissions in the country, and the emissions in power generation account for approximately 41 percent of all emissions in energy industries, Zhang said.Xinjiang is endowed with resources like wind and abundant solar energy, he said, which are a tremendous potential for the development of new energies. Zhang believes that promoting the development of clean coal power in Xinjiang is an important measure to ensure the safe and reliable supply of energy. A new power system requires a certain amount of clean and efficient coal-fired thermal power to ensure a secure supply of energy, safeguard national energy security and achieve the target of carbon emissions reduction.Xinjiang is rich in energy resources, including wind and solar power, and boasts a massive power generation capacity. With power transmission channels built, the region can transfer and sell some unused power to other parts of China.In addition, the construction of power transmission infrastructure has driven the development of thermal, wind and photovoltaic power generation in the region. Xinjiang has transferred 503.7 billion kWh of locally-generated electricity to other parts of the country since 2010, Xinhua News Agency reported in February citing the State Grid's Xinjiang branch.Among them, 137.8 billion kWh were generated with photovoltaic and wind power. It is equivalent to burning 41 million tons of standard coal, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide by 110 million tons and greatly contributing to China's green and low-carbon energy transition.
