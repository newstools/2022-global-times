The promise was made after the case of the "chained woman with eight children" heightened public attention on human trafficking.China will crack down hard on the trafficking of women and children and protect their lawful rights and interests, said Li, noting that the system for supporting and caring for senior citizens and people with disabilities will also be improved.His remarks were made after the high-profile case involving a woman suspected of being trafficked in Fengxian county, East China's Jiangsu Province, sparked social outcry.A total of 17 people were punished or put under investigation in late February after a video of the chained woman in a dilapidated hut wearing thin clothes in freezing winter in Fengxian county went viral on Chinese social media and infuriated netizens demanding help for the woman and an investigation into the case.Trafficking of women wasn't specifically addressed during last year's government work report, which said in general that the legitimate rights of women, children, the elderly and disabled should be protected. Following the chained woman's case, China's Ministry of Public Security announced on Wednesday that it has launched a nationwide campaign to crack down on the trafficking of women and children.Chinese legislators also called for heavier punishment for buyers and those complicit in human trafficking cases, with some saying that it is highly expected for the proposals to be implemented with such high public attention. Global Times
