"This year, for the first time in the history of Egypt, we are expected to reach 10 million tons of wheat production." Egypt has wheat reserves sufficient for four months, and with continuing local wheat production, it is expected to be sufficient till the end of 2022, he noted.Egypt has reserves of basic commodities, including wheat, cooking oil, rice, poultry, meat and others sufficient for four to six months, according to Madbouly. The worldwide inflation surge led the US Federal Reserve to recently increase its interest rate, and several central banks across the world have followed suit.Madbouly said it is "likely" that Egypt is going to increase its interest rate too. "The percentages and timings are completely subject to the assessment and evaluation of the Central Bank of Egypt," he added.Besides, Egypt plans to reduce the gross government debt from 85.8 percent to 75 percent of the GDP by 2026, revealed the prime minister.To face inflation, Egypt will provide 130 billion pounds (about $7 billion) in the coming general budget to ease part of the burdens suffered by the citizens, increase beneficiaries of social protection programs and maintain providing low-price food commodities, said Madbouly.Xinhua
