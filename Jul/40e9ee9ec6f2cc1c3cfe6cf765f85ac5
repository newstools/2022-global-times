The recent successful flight indicated a satisfactory completion of the project. Lightweight shipborne unmanned helicopters like AR-500BJ can be used for both military and civilian applications, such as maritime search and rescue, patrolling and investigation, experts said.  In December 2020, China's first domestically developed vessel-borne lightweight helicopter drone AR-500B made its maiden flight, making up for China's lack of a type of ship-based lightweight helicopter drone.Global Times
