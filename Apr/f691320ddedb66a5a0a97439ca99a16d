Illustration: Chen Xia/GTA sperm whale was found beached in East China's Zhejiang Province on Tuesday. A local rescue team acted immediately to help the sperm whale go back into the ocean with nearly 20-hour efforts. A TV broadcasting footage showed that due to the ebb tide, it was impossible to lift the 20-meter-long whale out of the sand, so rescue team members kept pouring water on the whale to keep it wet and waited for tides. As the tide began to rise in the night, a rescue boat tried to pull the whale into the water, and the process lasted nearly 10 hours before the whale finally got back into the sea. This was not the first time the local people have rescued beached whales. As China pays more attention to ecological environment protection, more and more wild animals are increasingly being treated friendly across the country. With such an eco-friendly approach in mind, China has showed the world its resolute in environment and climate protection. The recent story of the immigrating elephants is a vivid example, and now the beached whales. It is believed that China will continue further on this path to fulfill its ecological environment commitment.
