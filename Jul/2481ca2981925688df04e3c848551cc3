BYD's Hong Kong-listed stock sank 11.93 percent as of Tuesday's closing.Western Capital Group LLC, which is 100 percent owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was BYD's fourth-largest shareholder with 225 million shares, or 7.73 percent, according to BYD's 2022 first-quarter report. Berkshire first bought 225 million shares in BYD in September 2008 for HK$1.8 billion ($230 million).Li noted that BYD has good development prospects and a high market valuation.BYD was viewed as a bellwether stock for the Chinese EV sector and had a share surge in recent months. Its share price reached a record high of HK$325 in June, thanks to government stimulus measures designed to boost auto consumption.The company posted record sales in the first half of 2022. It sold 641,400 new-energy vehicles, up 315 percent year-on-year, and surpassed Tesla to become the global sales leader in the sector.The volatility in BYD's stock price could also be a result of the market adjusting after a rally in the new-energy vehicle sector, Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Tuesday."Some short-term speculations will not change the long-term investment value of enterprises and the good development prospect of China's new-energy vehicles market," Yang said.
