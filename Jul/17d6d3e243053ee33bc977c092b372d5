The Argentine government confirmed on Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with its three main groups of private creditors and other minority bondholders to restructure a part of the country's foreign debt, valued at 66.2 billion U.S. dollars.

Scioli was vice president under president Nestor Kirchner, and close to his wife, Cristina Kirchner. AFP
