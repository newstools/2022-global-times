Photo: AFPThe serious issue of migrants and refugees faced by the US is a boomerang of its own hegemonic and bullying practice, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday, urging the US to stop acting as a hypocritical "defender" of human rights and respond to Latin American countries' concerns on migration with practical solutions at the ninth Summit of the Americas.Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a regular press briefing on Monday, commenting on the serious refugees and migrants issue in the US as migration is one topic on the agenda of the summit.Data from US Customs and Border Protection showed that US law enforcement authorities processed over 230,000 encounters with illegal migrants at the US-Mexico border and ports of entry in April 2022.In 2021, US law enforcement departments have processed more than 1.7 million encounters of illegal migrants including 145,000 children, at the US-Mexico border, a 20-year high, Zhao said, noting that more than 2,800 migrant children were separated from their parents under the family separation policies imposed by the previous administration, and many parents are still looking for their children.Of the 266,000 migrant children detained in the US during recent years, 25,000 have been under custody for more than 100 days. Even at the worst time amid the pandemic, a large number of unaccompanied children were being detained for long periods in overcrowded temporary facilities, without oversight and in a shortage of medical care or medication, with their mental health being harmed.Tragedies at the border constitute an ignominious chapter of the numerous US human rights crimes, Zhao said, noting that the US government has taken drastic measures and inhumane actions against undocumented immigrants. Migrants often suffer violent law enforcement, face prolonged detention and abuse, and the human rights of vulnerable groups such as women and children are ruthlessly violated, Zhao said.The US should seriously examine and correct its crimes on the refugees and migrants issue, stop acting as a hypocritical "defender" of human rights, and take effective measures to protect the human rights and fundamental rights of refugees and migrants, Zhao said. The US should officially respond to the concerns of Latin American countries on the issue of migration with practical solutions at the ninth Summit of the Americas which will be held in Los Angeles, from June 6 to 10, according to Zhao.In the past 200 years since the US declared the Monroe Doctrine, it has engaged in military interventions in Latin American countries more than 30 times, forcibly exported its brand of democracy to the region, implemented predatory economic policies and even incited regime subversion, Zhao noted.
