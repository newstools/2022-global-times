China has been Russia's largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years.Following sanctions imposed on Russian by the West in February, the first shipments  of Russian coal and oil paid for in the Chinese currency will be delivered to independent Chinese refiners in May, as Russian sellers give buyers in China the flexibility to pay in yuan, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the purchase.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly expressed Western sanctions against Russia and said that China will continue to carry out normal trade cooperation with Russia.
