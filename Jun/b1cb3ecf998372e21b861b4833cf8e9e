Nigerian troops have found two former schoolgirls who were abducted by Boko Haram jihadists eight years ago, the military said Tuesday, freeing some of the last victims of the 2014 Chibok abduction.The two women each carried ­babies on their laps as they were ­presented by the Nigerian military, after captivity with militants who stormed their school in April 2014 in ­northeast Nigeria in a mass kidnapping that sparked international outrage.Major General Christopher Musa, military commander of troops in the region, told reporters the girls were found on June 12 and 14 in two different locations by troops. "We are very lucky to have been able to recover two of the Chibok girls," Musa said.  Dozens of Boko Haram militants stormed the Chibok girls' boarding school in 2014 and packed 276 ­pupils, aged 12-17, at the time into trucks in the jihadist group's first mass school abduction.Fifty-seven of the girls managed to escape by jumping from the trucks shortly after their abduction while 80 were released in exchange for some detained Boko Haram commanders following negotiations with the Nigerian government.In the recent releases, one of the women, Hauwa Joseph, was found along with other civilians on June 12 around Bama after troops dislodged a Boko Haram camp, while the other, Mary Dauda, was found later outside Ngoshe village in Gwoza district, near the border with Cameroon.
