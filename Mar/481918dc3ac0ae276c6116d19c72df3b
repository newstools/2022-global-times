"The South African government is compelled to act to remedy the... breach declared by the high court," the environmentalists groups' lawyer Tim Lloyd told AFP on Tuesday.Exposure to toxic materials emitted by coal plants including sulphur dioxide, mercury and fine particles, has resulted in an "epidemic" of asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer, the organizations said.Air pollution caused between 305 and 650 premature deaths in the region in 2016, according to a study by a US atmospheric scientist, Andy Gray.Government's environmental affairs ministry in 2012 published an air management plan for the region, but it was never implemented. AFP
