"However we feel about masks, I think we can all agree that this is positive progress."Martinez said CPS was one of the first major districts to require universal masking, and one of the last school districts to relax the mandate. The vast majority of schools in US Midwest state of Illinois ended masking requirements in late February following Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's halting of the school mask mandate, as well as prompted by new federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But CPS had continued its mask mandate due to an agreement they'd reached with the Chicago Teachers Union following five days of canceled classes in January, after union members declined to teach in person due to safety concerns.Xinhua
