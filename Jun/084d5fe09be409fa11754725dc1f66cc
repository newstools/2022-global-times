People help with search and rescue operations at a collapsed building after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan in the Spera district of Khost Province, on June 22, 2022. The death toll has hit 1,000, disaster management officials said, with more than 600 injured and the toll expected to grow as information trickles in from remote mountain villages.

We have nothing. Our food and clothes...everything is under rubble," Hazrat Ali, 18, told a Reuters team in Wor Kali, a village of the hardest-hit Barmal district."I have lost my brothers; my heart is broken. Now we are just two. I loved them a lot."After the earthquake disaster in Afghanistan, the Chinese government has decided to provide 50 million yuan ($7.46 million) of emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday.Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks in response to a query on the progress of China's emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.Aid provided by China will include tents, towels, folding beds and other materials urgently needed by the Afghan people, he said. In the next step, China will coordinate closely with the Afghan interim government to ensure that relief supplies are delivered to those in need as soon as possible, and to help the Afghan people tide over their current difficulties, Wang said.Agencies
