By combining talent resources with high-end industries, incunabular R&D projects could be first rolled out in Hong Kong and then by taking advantage of the integrated development of the Greater Bay Area, AI technology could be industrialized and commercialized, and simultaneously enter the mainland and international markets, Shang said. Vitaly Pentegov, CEO of UrbanChain Group, a company based in the science park, also looks forward to a deeper integration of Hong Kong’s innovation sector into the national development plan and believes the new plans would take the integration of GBA cities to a new level."The GBA and northern metropolis plan implied easier commute, cross-border transactions and acknowledgement of technology exchange procedures,” Pentegov told the Global Times on Friday.His company provides software and hardware solutions to AI-driven parking, property and mobility solutions.“My company is interested in the GBA market, and we are waiting for quarantine restrictions to be eased, so we can schedule the visit to our clients and prospects in Shenzhen right away,” Pentegov said.The science park is the largest research and development and business incubation base in Hong Kong, and is currently home to more than 1,100 enterprises and 17,000 innovators.
