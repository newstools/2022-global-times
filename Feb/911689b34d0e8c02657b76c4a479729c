Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addresses a crowd via a video conference in the capital Tehran, Iran on January 9, 2022. Negotiating does not mean giving in to the enemy, he said as talks are taking place in Vienna between his country and world powers on the nuclear issue.

That prompted Iran to begin rolling back on its own commitments.Tehran has also restricted some inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog.The IAEA indicated in November that no progress has been made in resolving several questions it had regarding the previous presence of nuclear material at undeclared sites in the Islamic republic.From Iran's point of view, this file "must be closed," Khatibzadeh told state TV."We answered questions or political claims raised by the IAEA about some of our country's actions in the past... no one should keep the channel open for political pressures in the future," he said.The Vienna talks seek to return the US to the agreement, notably through the lifting of sanctions, and to restore Iran's compliance with its own commitments. Tehran says it wants to verify the removal of sanctions and get guarantees that the US will not repeat its withdrawal from the agreement.On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Tehran was studying a rough draft to revive the nuclear deal.AFP
