Observers predict that the flotilla this time led by the Lhasa, the second ship in the Type 055 class, could repeat this voyage in a similar way.A Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday that at this time, when Japan and the US have been making repeated provocations on China over the Taiwan question, the PLA's naval activities serve as a warning to them, as some of the most important Japanese and US military bases are located on the east side of Japan, like the US Navy base in Yokosuka.  The US and Japan should realize and get used to the fact that the PLA is fully capable of safeguarding China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and developmental interests, and they should stop hyping the so-called "China threat" theory, attempting to contain China militarily and interfering in the Taiwan question, which is an internal affair of China, the expert said.The PLA flotilla's far sea drills are a deterrent to "Taiwan independence" secessionist and foreign military interfering forces, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times.Wei said that the powerful Lhasa has reached 100 percent operational capability, and it can carry out military missions in the far sea as the core of a flotilla.Just a few days ago, a flotilla of five warships from the Russian Navy also circumnavigated Japan, according to Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff. It is yet unclear whether the Russian naval activities were related to the Chinese naval activities like in last year's joint maritime patrol, as the two countries' vessels were not close to each other like last time, observers said.
