A renewable energy base in Sihong County, East China's Jiangsu Province is seen on Sunday as wind turbines spin. The base can generate 650 million kilowatt-hours of power annually, with tax revenue of 50 million yuan ($7.7 million). The annual income of fishery breeding amounts to 45 million yuan, and tourism income to 20 million yuan. A total of 640,000 tons of carbon emissions can be avoided every year.

"However, the actual contribution will depend on the success of parallel energy efficiency measures to keep the region's energy demand in check."The EU set a goal of slashing its heavy reliance on Russian natural gas by two thirds in 2022 following the Ukraine crisis."Energy market developments in recent months - especially in Europe - have proven once again the essential role of renewables in improving energy security, in addition to their well-established effectiveness at reducing emissions," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. AFP
