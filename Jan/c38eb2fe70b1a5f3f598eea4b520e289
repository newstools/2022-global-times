The space industry will contribute more to China's development, to global consensus and common efforts in outer space exploration and utilization, and to human progress, its preface noted. Future outlooksIn terms of manned spaceflight project, China plans to launch the Wentian and Mengtian experimental modules, the Xuntian space station telescope, Shenzhou manned spacecraft and Tianzhou cargo spacecraft in the next five years, according to the white paper.China's space station is expected to be completed in 2022, and the white paper said that China will build a space laboratory on board and place astronauts on long-term assignments to perform large-scale scientific experiments and maintenance.Studies on human lunar landing, new-generation manned spacecraft, and research on key technologies to lay the foundation for exploring and developing cislunar space will also be carried out in this period. Currently, the three-member Shenzhou-13 crew are living and working in the Tianhe space station module, halfway through their record-long six-month stay in space. China will also pursue new milestones in deep space exploration.

Those two missions would be launched around 2025, during which the development for the Chang'e-8 mission will start simultaneously, the official said. China's Chang'e-7 mission also includes an agreement with Russia's Luna-26 mission, and the two would explore the moon together, Liu said.Chang'e-8's launch, according to Liu, could be expected before 2030, and would involve verifying key technology for the lunar station. Launching asteroid probes to sample near-earth asteroids and probe main-belt comets and complete key technological research on Mars sampling and return, exploration of the Jupiter system, and to study plans for boundary exploration of the solar system are also on the list of things to do for China's space industry in the next five years. China on Friday released further details surrounding the construction of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), saying that the open and inclusive project jointly proposed by China and Russia is expected to become operational by 2035."Governments of China and Russia are working closely on the ILRS agreements and have basically reached a consensus, and the agreement will hopefully be signed later this year. After that, a joint declaration on the project will be announced to the world by the national space agencies of the two countries," CNSA deputy head Wu Yanhua told the Global Times on Friday at the press conference. China and Russia are working on a draft of a legally binding intergovernmental agreement on the project, which is due to be signed in 2022, Russia's national space agency Roscosmos said in an exclusive interview with the Global Times in December 2021.Roscosmos hailed the ILRS as the largest current cooperation project between the two "longstanding and reliable partners" in the space field, and said that the ILRS enables the construction of a station by 2035 on the lunar surface, while experimental and research facilities for a wide range of scientific work would operate in lunar orbit.At all stages, at all levels of construction, and in terms of sharing of research data and space-ground support system, we have set no limits and welcome the world to join in its construction, Wu said.Just like the Antarctic and Arctic research stations, we are inclined to build such a facility at the lunar south pole, and construct a scientific laboratory facility on the moon's surface as well as in lunar orbit, in order to conduct multi-discipline research work.Wu elaborated that China's phase-4 lunar probe would pursue the goal of constructing a basic form of the ILRS. In five years, China's Chang'e-6 and -7 missions would join forces with their Russian counterparts to complete scouting and surveying work before construction begins. In another 10 years, the construction of the town-like facility would be delivered, which would be equipped with an energy supply system, communication functions, as well as a space-Earth commuting system, among others. "A life supporting system would also be necessary to support human activity in the long run," Wu told the Global Times.According to Wu, the ILRS will be able to receive visitors from Earth on scientific missions of various countries and organizations.China and Russia welcome international peers to join in the project, Wu stressed.

China successfully sends the Tianhui-4 satellite into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwest of the country on December 29, 2021. The launch marked the 404th mission of the Long March series carrier rockets.

Researching plans on building a near-Earth object defense system, and increasing the capacity of near-Earth object monitoring, cataloguing, early warning and response is also on the schedule.Analysts said such plans are of great necessity, and China's efforts will not only make contributions to the opposition of the militarization of space, but also safeguard the safety of humanity as a whole. It is time to deal with space debris and traffic chaos, and China has experienced increasing challenges in recent years, as it builds satellite infrastructure and a space station, they said.China could lead the designing of laws in the space sector at the United Nations, hopefully making it a UN resolution to protect all, Song Zhongping, a space observer and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday.

"China has proven its strong capabilities in different domains of space technology, and those who have yet to develop their own would benefit from the infrastructure and technology China has built, which is great news for all."
