Bush, Bill Clinton - and the former first ladies - appeared together in a one-minute video released in March 2021, endorsing the US vaccination campaign and sharing what they missed about pre-pandemic life."This vaccine means hope," Obama said in the video. "It will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease."In August 2021, Obama scaled back his 60th birthday celebrations due to the spread of the Delta variant. Conservative political opponents had lashed out at the former president for planning to host an outdoor party - in which attendees were required to be vaccinated - that had been expected to draw hundreds of guests after Democrats had criticized Donald Trump's administration for organizing several maskless events at the White House. Obama reiterated his support for the vaccine in his tweet Sunday, saying his own positive test was "a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven't already, even as cases go down."AFP
