Photo: VCGMajor international airlines rushed to rejig or cancel flights to the US ahead of a 5G wireless rollout on Wednesday that has triggered safety concerns, despite two wireless carriers saying they will delay parts of the deployment.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that potential 5G interference could affect height readings that play a key role in bad-weather landings on some jets and airlines say the Boeing 777 is among models initially in the spotlight.Despite an announcement by AT&T and Verizon that they would pause the 5G rollout near airports, several airlines still canceled flights or switched aircraft models. Others said more cancelations were likely unless the FAA issued new formal guidance in the wake of the wireless announcements."While this is a positive development toward preventing widespread disruptions to flight operations, some flight restrictions may remain," Delta Air Lines said.The world's largest operator of the Boeing 777, Dubai's Emirates, said it would suspend flights to nine US destinations from January 19, the planned date for the deployment of 5G wireless services.Emirates flights to New York's JFK, Los Angeles and Washington, DC will continue to operate.Japan's two major airlines, All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, said they would curtail Boeing 777 flights.ANA said it was canceling or changing the aircraft used on some US flights. JAL said it would not use the 777 on US mainland routes "until safety is confirmed," according to a notice to passengers reported by airline publication Skift.Korean Air Lines said it had switched away from 777s and 747-8s on six US passenger and cargo flights and expected to also change planes used on another six flights on Wednesday.Air India, which serves four US destinations with Boeing 777s, said those flights would be curtailed or face changes in aircraft type starting from Wednesday.The announcement of cancelations came despite the wireless carriers delaying turning on some 5G towers near key airports.Airline industry sources said the decision had arrived too late to affect complex aircraft and crewing decisions for some Wednesday flights.British Airways opted to switch aircraft on its daily flight to Los Angeles to an Airbus A380 from the usual Boeing 777 service, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
