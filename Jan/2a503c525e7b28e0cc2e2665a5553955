In the technology sector, Shenzhen aims to take the lead in the country to ease market access for cross-border data business. Measures will be taken to relax market access for data trading and cross-border data services. The city will also prepare to establish a data element exchange center, when conditions permit, according to the guideline.The measures are conducive to paving the way for the market-oriented reform of data elements in China, and help accelerate the opening-up of Shenzhen's information service industry as well as the development of digital trade and other new forms of business, officials said.In 2021, the added value of core industries of the digital economy accounted for about 30 percent of GDP in Shenzhen, ranking high among large and medium-sized cities in China in terms of scale and quality.In the financial sector, Shenzhen has plans to improve the convenience of cross-border trade settlements.In the field of transportation, Shenzhen will establish unified access standards and open application platforms for all-space unmanned systems on land, sea and air.Measures in the medical field include easing market access for medicines and medical devices as well as trials of online sales of prescribed medicines. "Shenzhen has always been at the forefront of reform and opening-up. By carrying out this pilot project, it can make good use of the advantages of its role as a demonstration zone as well as its industrial base and innovation gene in promoting the nation's high-level opening-up and dual circulation strategy," Wang Peng, a professor at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The fields covered in the guideline are also the key areas for China's further opening-up and high-quality development, Zheng Lei, a chief economist with Glory Sun Financial Group, told the Global Times on Wednesday."Shenzhen has more advantages than other cities in China in terms of its location, industrial base and social development. It is expected that the pilot in Shenzhen will be promoted to the GBA first and provide an example to the rest of the country," Zheng said.
