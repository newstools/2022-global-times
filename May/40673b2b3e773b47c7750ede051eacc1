foreign trade Photo:VCGGrowth of China's home appliance exports slowed significantly in the first quarter of 2022, according to latest industry data, as both the supply and demand sides were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But growth is expected to return to stable levels, once the epidemic eases, a trade expert said on Sunday.China's home appliance exports in the first quarter stood at $28.52 billion, a year-on-year increase of 3.6 percent, significantly slower than a growth rate of 67.5 percent a year earlier, according to the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCMB). The US, Japan and Germany were the top three export markets. However, the growth rates for the US and European countries slowed, while the market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) grew.The first-quarter growth rate for exports to ASEAN was 17.2 percent, compared with 5 percent for North America and 1.4 percent for Europe. The growth rates for Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand were 26.56 percent, 19.44 percent and 14.08 percent, respectively. The CCCMB suggested that global inflation, a high base in the second half of 2021 and slower demand as many overseas markets reduced quarantine restrictions caused the decline.The value in the same period of 2021 was $27.56 billion and full-year exports rose 26.6 percent to $118.41 billion, both 10-year highs, according to a report by the industry body. The sharp slowdown was due to issues on both the supply and demand sides, Bai Ming, deputy director of the International Market Research Institute of the MOFCOM, told the Global Times on Sunday."China's two essential manufacturing bases, the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, were affected by the coronavirus, and China's major home appliance buyers such as the US and European countries eased their quarantine policies, all of which reduced exports," said Bai.The CCCMB said ASEAN will be the center for industry investment from China in the next five to 10 years, with the expansion of local markets and the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which is expected to significantly boost trade.Bai said exports are unlikely to expand much in the next three quarters, but the growth rate will soon recover to normal levels, when the epidemic is brought under effective control.Customs data showed that China's total exports to ASEAN reached 1.35 trillion yuan ($202.51 billion) in the first quarter, a year-on-year increase of 8.4 percent, accounting for 14.4 percent of the country's overall trade. ASEAN returned to being China's largest trade partner in the first quarter after the EU took the lead in January and February.
