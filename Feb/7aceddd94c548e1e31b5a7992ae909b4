"Our £160 million pledge will support CEPI's vital work to cut vaccine development to 100 days and protect us all against future health threats." The announcement came ahead of the Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit in London on March 7 and 8, which will be attended by leading global politicians, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden. The event aims to raise funds for CEPI's goal to develop "variant-proof" vaccines that will work against multiple future COVID-19 strains.Western nations have faced criticism over the lack of availability of vaccines in poorer and developing nations during the coronavirus pandemic, with former prime minister Gordon Brown accusing leaders of "unforgivable moral failure."AFP
