"Since the start of the truce, we have seen a significant reduction of violence," Grundberg told a virtual press conference last week.However, both sides have traded blame over violations, with the government accusing the rebels of military deployments and drone attacks while the insurgents say they "repelled an advance" by loyalists. A Yemeni military source also told AFP on Friday that loyalist forces had "repelled a Huthi attack" in southern Marib, the government's last stronghold in the north of the country.Grundberg has urged all parties to exercise "restraint," tweeting that he was "following very closely the latest developments in Marib."On Thursday, Yemen's Riyadh-based President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi announced he was handing over his powers to a new leadership council tasked with reaching a "final political solution" with the Huthis.AFP
