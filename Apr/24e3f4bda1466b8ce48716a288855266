According to the investigation by local police, the 50-year-old suspect surnamed Zhang who was in charge of the apartment building in Zhangmiao community in Baoshan did not distribute the donation of food supplies to the intended recipients, the tenants in the building, after he received 190 cases of goods, instead, he resold them to a compound in Jing’an district. According to a statement released by the Zhangmiao community on the Baoshan government’s official Sina Weibo account, Qujing city in Yunnan Province had donated 50 tons of agricultural products such as baby cabbages, tomatoes, corns and chives to Baoshan. The material group of the district epidemic prevention and control office decided to distribute a total of 7,692 cases of food supplies to Zhangmiao community where the long-term tenants, most of whom are migrant workers and other disadvantaged groups, have been suffering from food shortages and have asked for help many times. However, when he received the 190 cases of materials last Friday morning, Zhang did not distribute them to the tenants in the apartment building which he was in charge of, but sold them to a compound in Jing’an district. Zhang has since been apprehended by the local police and the investigation into the case is ongoing. This incident reflects that there are still loopholes in the distribution and management of donated materials in our community, which has left opportunities for individual lawbreakers to take advantage of, the Zhangmiao community authority apologized in the statement, promising that they would further improve the management process for the distribution of donated materials, make up for the loopholes and prevent similar incidents from happening again.
