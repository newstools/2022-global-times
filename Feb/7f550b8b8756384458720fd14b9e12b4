The ministry said that output at factories and mines "is showing signs of an upward movement."According to the ministry's data, industries that mainly contributed to the decrease in production in the recording period were motor vehicles, iron, steel and nonferrous metals and inorganic and organic chemicals, in that order.Output in the auto industry dropped the most, diving 17.2 percent, as the rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant of coronavirus Japan-wide caused factories to be suspended and rattled supply chains, a ministry official was quoted as saying.As for organic and inorganic chemicals, output dropped 3.8 percent as the pandemic and a large earthquake in southwestern Japan also forced some plants to temporarily shutter operations in the reporting month.The ministry said, meanwhile, that industries helping to trim losses by their output gaining in the recording period, included electronic parts and devices, production machinery, chemicals, in that order.Xinhua
