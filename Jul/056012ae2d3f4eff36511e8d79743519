Editor's Note:With the successful launch of Long March-5B Y3 carrier rocket from the tropical island of South China's Hainan Province, China's Shenzhou-14 crew has received, amid earnest expectations, their first visitor in space - Wentian lab module, the second part of the three-module space station, also the "heaviest buddy" among all single space modules in active service in the world. The successful docking of Wentian with the space station has verified the country's ability to assemble ultra-large spacecraft in orbit. Before China, only the former Soviet Union and the US were capable of the feat. People on Earth shall witness the construction of the China Space Station with an unprecedented speed in mankind's history in the coming months. If all goes well, the Shenzhou-14 crew will be tasked with the most challenging mission in China's manned spaceflight history.
