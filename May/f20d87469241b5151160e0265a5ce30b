The participants were recruited between December 5, 2020 and January 9, 2021. Seroconversion rates one month after the second dose were 99.7 percent and 0.8 percent respectively for the two groups, according to the report.BNT162b2-elicited sera at one month after the second dose also neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Alpha, Beta and Delta, read the report. The data cut-off date for this analysis was February 07, 2021, according to the document. So it does not give any data on the vaccine's efficacy against the dominating Omicron variant that was firstly discovered in South Africa in November 2021.Some observers said this would cast more uncertainty on the approval of the vaccine in the Chinese mainland as Chinese vaccine manufacturers have been trying to develop Omicron-specific or next-generation vaccines to deal with the rapidly mutating virus.For example, three inactivated vaccines against Omicron developed by major Chinese vaccine producers Sinopharm and Sinovac have been approved for clinical research in Hong Kong.  Chinese vaccine developer CanSinoBIO's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has received the approval for clinical trial application in China in April. The inhaled booster vaccine developed by CanSinoBIO also proved able to elicite a potent immune response against the Omicron variant after inactivated COVID-19 vaccine priming, reports said.
