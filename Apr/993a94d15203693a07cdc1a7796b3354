"Let them fool themselves."In October 2021, Taiwan secessionists boasted of the result of computer simulation from the Han Kuang exercise, which showed that the island troops optimized "battle force preservation and troop transfer" in the first wave of a PLA attack, defeat "PLA's invasion."If the PLA were forced to settle the Taiwan question by force, it would certainly be like a thunderbolt: with greater equipment superiority to achieve a quick and decisive victory. Keep the island from receiving any military aid through a complete blockade, Song said.
