This has triggered alarms on the island of Taiwan on whether the US military will come to Taiwan's aid if the Chinese mainland decides to reunify with the breakaway island by force.The US warship's latest Taiwan Straits transit sent a wrong signal to the Taiwan secessionists, analysts said, noting that the move should not be misinterpreted as the US military's readiness to fight for the island, because a regular, non-combat voyage is not the same as that, some analysts said.Whether the Taiwan authorities will be abandoned by the US or not, the PLA ought to be ready to resolve the Taiwan question under all circumstances, including scenarios that the US military interferes, Song said.The Taiwan authorities should give up its illusions and must stop secessionist attempts, Song said.On the other hand, the US military, government and media are hyping that Taiwan could be the next Ukraine, throwing mud at the Chinese mainland in order to make the reunification more difficult, and ramp up stock prices for the US military-industrial complex, analysts said.But Taiwan is not Ukraine, as Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. “The Taiwan region’s peace hinges on the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, rather than fawning on foreign forces for arms sales and military support,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a routine press conference on Wednesday."Taiwan independence" only leads to a dead end, and no one should have any illusion or make any miscalculation on this issue, Hua said.
