The pack has undergone specialized training to provide services under complex situations and cold environments.After extensive training and testing, these dogs are able to guide blind athletes independently during the games, the Global Times learned from the China Guide Dog Dalian Training Base in Northeast China's Liaoning Province on Friday.The dogs serving in the Paralympics have been strictly selected and scientifically trained, according to the training base. The base wished the dogs' special warmth, loyalty, and response to commands will help the blind athletes fully enjoy the games and better integrate into the larger Olympic family, media reported.The guide dogs will also wear the anti-counterfeiting traceability code with China's independent intellectual property rights for the first time, from which people can learn more than a dozen bits of detailed information about the dogs, such as their bloodline, age, training, and service conditions.China established the first guide dog training institution in 2006. In 2008, two guide dogs appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Paralympic Games. Ping Yali, China's first Paralympic gold medalist, completed the penultimate torch relay under the guidance of guide dog Lucky; the other guide dog, Star, appeared in the team of the Chinese delegation, accompanied by Li Duan, a blind long jumper.
