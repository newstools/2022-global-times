Dulong women are weaving. Photo: VCGChina's poverty reduction work is accented by the milestone of eradication of the Dulong people's plight, behind which the key factors are the determination of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee in poverty reduction as well as effective poverty eradication measures. China's experience and practice could also contribute to the anti-poverty battle around the world.The Dulong people are an ethnic minority that resides in the mountains of Southwest China's Yunnan Province. Its people, bidding farewell to an archaic lifestyle only after the founding of New China in 1949, had long endured poverty and poor transportation to the outside world. In 2018, the six administrative villages in Dulongjiang Township, Gongshan county, eradicated poverty. In February 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that China has secured a "complete victory" in its fight against poverty.The final battle against poverty in the past few years faced extra difficulties, as poverty-stricken regions happened to be usually remote and isolated, with much less developed economies and far more conservative cultures, and lacked natural resources and were hard to reach by conventional means. In a word, these regions were at a disadvantaged position in development.However, the CPC Central Committee has taken up poverty reduction as a significant political task to be completed and attached great importance to the campaign, which shows its great determination in winning the battle against poverty.The actions taken in the campaign, including targeted poverty alleviation, have been proven effective and have delivered the expected outcomes.During the process, countless CPC members have shouldered great responsibility and performed as pioneers in the frontline in alleviating poverty and elevating people's livelihoods, in line with what past CPC generations have done at different times.It once again reminds us that the CPC is a political party that seeks people's happiness and progress for humanity.Over the past four decades, the country has lifted nearly 800 million people out of poverty based on the $1.9 dollar per day global poverty line, said the report jointly released by the Ministry of Finance, the Development Research Center of the State Council, and the World Bank in March, 2022, according to the Xinhua News Agency.The figure accounts for about 75 percent of global poverty reduction in the same period, the report noted.Development is the right of all countries, rather than the exclusive privilege of a few. The CPC seeks happiness for the Chinese people, and also the wellbeing of all others.The experience and wisdom of China in poverty reduction has also been extended to other countries and helps more people to seek their happiness in development.The article was written based on an interview with Yu Shaoxiang, chief research fellow with the National Institute of Social Development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
