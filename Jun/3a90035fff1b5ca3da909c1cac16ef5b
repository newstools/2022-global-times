If it is not passed on July 1, the more than 475,000 Israelis living there will no longer receive the same rights as other Israelis - including voting rights.  According to Israeli commentators, the right-wing opposition, led by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, will not block the renewal of the pro-settlement measures.AFP
