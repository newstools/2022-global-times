The museum is located at Al-Ataba Square in Central Cairo, on the second floor of the Central Post Office. The museum was established in February 1934. The museum contains a collection of artifacts, pictures and documents illustrating the ways in which messages have been delivered within Egypt over the centuries.The whole building dedicated to the museum is now run by the National Postal Authority (Egypt Post), which belongs to the Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology."We set a plan in 2019 to develop the Egyptian National Postal Authority as a whole. The development of the iconic post office building was part of the development plan," said Minister of Communications and Information Technology Amr Talaat."We renovated the museum and increased its items, unveiling unique old items from the storehouses, restoring them and exhibiting them in the museum," the minister told the Xinhua News Agency on Thursday, a day after the renovated museum was inaugurated by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.  Once a visitor reaches the first floor of the museum, they encounter a bust of Egypt's ruler Khedive Ismail, who bought Posta Europea, a company operating in Egypt then, and established Egypt's first postal authority in 1865. Each hall of the museum tells a story of the development of Egypt's postal history and philately. There is a wide range of exhibits: a mummified carrier pigeon, ancient writing tools that date back to the pharaonic era, postage stamps and mailboxes from the 19th century, and postmen's uniforms."Among the most important items in the museum are the first editions of Egyptian postage stamps, because this is the pride of every country," as Heba Barakat, adviser to the head of Egypt's postal authority for museum affairs, noted. "The first Egyptian stamps were issued in 1866 and they were the first to be issued in Africa and the Arab world," he added.The museum also has an exhibition hall showing postage stamps from different parts of the world gifted to Egypt during the Universal Postal Union's 10th Conference hosted by the North African country.It displays old postage stamps from almost all countries of the world including Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Ireland, Turkey, Morocco, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China.Speaking of China, Barakat said the Egyptian Postal Museum is eying cooperation with its Chinese counterpart, the China National Post and Postage Stamp Museum in Beijing."We're planning fruitful cooperation with the Chinese side to know more about each other's cultures and share the history of our postal services and stamps," postal authority's adviser told Xinhua, adding the Egypt Post has been in touch with the Egyptian ambassador to China to discuss future arrangements.   Xinhua
