Rogozin said.Although US space agency NASA soon clarified that it "continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station," space analysts said it is very doubtful how long such cooperation will last, since the chance of Russia extending support after 2024 is significantly affected due to the ongoing conflict.
