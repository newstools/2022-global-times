From January to June this year, bilateral trade reached $184.25 billion, up 9.4 percent year-on-year, surpassing China-Japan trade, according to the Ministry of Commerce last week.South Korea used to be China's fourth largest agricultural products export destination. But the country has kept high tariff rates in place to protect its domestic industry, curbing Chinese exports to South Korea.
