No conclusion should be drawn from the photos, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday.But it is natural and necessary for China to develop more advanced submarines as part of its plan to modernize its military, Song said.China's attack submarines are evolving to tackle a growing range of potential demands, from protecting ballistic missile submarines and the aircraft carrier battle groups to tracking enemy ships, Reuters said.China is now facing serious external threats from countries like the US, so it must develop strong enough military capabilities and comprehensive national strength, Song said.In 2021 alone, the US sent at least 11 nuclear-powered attack submarines to the South China Sea with an obvious intent to deter China, according to a report released in March by the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a Beijing-based think tank. US submarine activities were so intensive that they resulted in an accident - the Seawolf-class nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Connecticut suffered an underwater collision in the South China Sea in October, 2021.Under the framework of the AUKUS alliance, the US and the UK are providing Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines for the first time in an attempt to contain China, even at the risk of nuclear proliferation.The US should not apply a double standard with the bully logic that only the US and its allies can develop military strength while others like China cannot, Song said.
