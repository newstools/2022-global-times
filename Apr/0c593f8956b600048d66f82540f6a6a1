The death rate will further be reduced to 0.14 percent with two doses and 0.03 percent with three doses of vaccine."Wang urged the elderly and those with underlying health conditions to get vaccinated and especially take a booster shot to truly reduce the ferocity of Omicron.Health experts also responded to worries that the Omicron variant is deadlier than the Delta variant, given that Hong Kong has reported much more deaths in the fifth wave of COVID-19 than in the four previous waves combined.According to the data in the UK and the US, the Omicron variant did cause more deaths than the previous Delta variant if counted in the same time period, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on the press conference.But the situation in the Chinese mainland is very different because the government has been adopting multiple measures to prevent and reduce deaths, Wu noted.Wu said the measures, including controlling the outbreak through early detection to avoid running out of medical resources, managing all positive infections to prevent mild cases turning into severe illness, treating severe cases with effective measures to reduce deaths and promoting COVID-19 vaccination.
