In the Yangtze River Delta region with Shanghai as the center, the number has dropped by about 12 percent, according to media reports.While operations at some major ports such as Shanghai and Ningbo remain largely smooth, ships often depart with fewer goods than they should have because of disruptions in goods deliveries to the port, Zhong Zhechao, founder of One Shipping, an international logistics service consulting company, told the Global Times on Sunday. Zhong said throughput will be hit as the result of the situation.Such disruptions have also impacted supplies of daily necessities to residents in COVID-19-affected areas, including Shanghai. However, industry insiders said the situation should be eased soon as governments are beefing up efforts to secure supply chains.The recent signals from the government are very clear and there is a certain urge to ease the situation of the logistics industry, Zhong said.
