Zhang Jun, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) Photo: CFPThe United Nations Security Council voted Wednesday on a Russian draft resolution on humanitarian issues in Ukraine. The vote was two in favor from Russia and China and 13 abstentions, which made the resolution fail to pass.The Russia-drafted resolution calling for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine has been defeated, and Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused those who abstained on Wednesday of doing so "for political reasons," Reuters reported.Explaining China's vote, Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, said the Chinese side had a "strong expectation" that there should be an immediate ceasefire, but that while pushing for a halt to the fighting, the council should "also respond to the humanitarian crisis in a positive, pragmatic and constructive manner.""China has been calling for maximum avoidance of civilian casualties and making every effort to ensure basic humanitarian needs," said Ambassador Zhang, noting that the fundamental reason for China to vote in favor of the resolution is to urge the international community to pay attention to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. Relevant parties should strengthen coordination on humanitarian issues, earnestly protect the safety of civilians, especially vulnerable groups such as women and children, and facilitate evacuation and humanitarian relief operations, Zhang noted.Zhang said that China pursues an independent foreign policy and has always decided its position on relevant issues based on the merits of the issue and with a responsible attitude.Zhang said the Ukrainian crisis has brought severe challenges to the world, and the key at present is for the parties concerned to show political will and find a proper solution through negotiations as soon as possible.The long-term solution to the crisis is to abandon the Cold War mentality, avoid bloc confrontation and build balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture through dialogue and negotiation on the basis of respecting each other's legitimate concerns, Zhang added.Besides, the United Nations General Assembly held its 11th emergency special session on Wednesday to discuss two draft resolutions on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine submitted by Ukraine and South Africa, with a vote expected on Thursday or Friday.Global Times
