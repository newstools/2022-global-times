All the necessary actions Beijing has taken to safeguard China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity are aimed at stopping secessionist activities and interference by external forces to safeguard the vital interests of compatriots on both sides of the Straits and the overall interests of the Chinese people, Ma said.Linking the Taiwan question with the completely different Ukraine situation is just a further stretch toward the wrong path for the DPP, and the DPP authority might have gone too far in its secessionist daydreaming, the Shanghai-based expert added. China's determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity is so strong that it will not allow anyone to trample on the bottom line of the Taiwan question, he noted. Chinese analysts also pointed out that the DPP authority should understand that the Ukraine situation shows that the US would only benefit from the chaos it introduces in the Taiwan Straits and ditch the island right away, leaving compatriots on the island as victims in the aftermath.US hegemony would gain benefits from any conflict in the world, as conflicts would be good news to the US dollar and American arms dealers, said Chang Ya-chung, Sun Yat-sen School president in Taiwan.The Ukraine situation is a lesson for the island of Taiwan - the Chinese mainland would not spare any efforts including by force to safeguard its core interests, and the island of Taiwan is at most an important interest for the US but never a core one, Chang said. The DPP is making a mistake to serve as a pawn of the US while treating the Chinese mainland as an enemy. When it reaches a point of maximum pressure as a result of US provocation, the compatriots on the island would suffer from DPP miscalculations, Chang warned.On the island's leader and "external affairs department" officials' linking the Ukraine crisis to the Taiwan question, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Wednesday that "it's a very insensible act.""Taiwan is not Ukraine and it's an irrefutable historical and juridical fact that Taiwan is always an inalienable part of China and the one-China principle is a recognized norm in international relations," Hua said.She also stressed that the peace of the region of Taiwan is decided by the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, rather than on brownnosing foreign forces for arms sales and military support. "Taiwan secession" is a dead end, on which none should have any misjudgment or misunderstanding.Some people always bring up Taiwan since the start of the Ukraine crisis, and their opinions expose their lack of basic knowledge of the history of the Taiwan question, Hua said.   It is common knowledge that the Taiwan question was caused by a civil war, and there is political confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait due to that civil war. However, China's sovereignty and territory have never been divided and cannot be divided. This is the status quo of the Taiwan question, Hua stressed.
