The guided-missile frigate Yantai (Hull 538) attached to a destroyer flotilla with the navy under the PLA Northern Theater Command fires its main gun at mock sea targets during a maritime live-fire training exercise in waters of the Yellow Sea in late July. The training exercise focused on subjects including striking maritime and aerial targets, joint search and rescue, anti-submarine operation, warship and airplane cooperative training.
