Almere, the latest, is a city that was itself created by the Dutch by draining part of the former Zuiderzee bay to reclaim land.As well as being a showcase for Dutch horticulture, each participating country has its own pavilion. China's is showing "new ways of using bamboo," said Jorritsma. Italy is focusing on permaculture, while France shows how metallic imitations of trees can be used to cool cities.The German pavilion is decorated with plants including garden plants, trees, food crops and wildflowers to form a "living ecosystem whose appearance would change throughout the exhibition," organizers said.The event has however been criticized for budget overruns that threatened its very existence. Dutch media have reported that Almere has significantly overrun its 10 million euro ($10.8 million) budget for the project.AFP
