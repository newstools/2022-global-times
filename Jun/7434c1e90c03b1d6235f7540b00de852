For instance, the country's exports in US dollar terms gained 16.9 percent year-on-year in May, more than double the market consensus of a jump of less than 8 percent, according to customs figures.This compared with a 3.9 percent increase in exports for April, a sharp fall from a 14.7 percent gain for March.
