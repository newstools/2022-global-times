Search and rescue workers carried safety ropes, life detectors, metal detectors and other equipment to expand the search area outside of the core area of the accident.One of the crashed Boeing 737's black boxes that was found on Wednesday was transferred to the decoding lab in Beijing on Wednesday night, and the data download and analysis of the black box is underway.The possibility of damage to the stored data cannot be ruled out.In response to media reports saying that US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that Chinese authorities had invited the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in the investigation, an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said at the press conference that after the incident, the CAAC reported the accident information to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the NTSB, the investigation body of the country where the crashed plane was designed, in accordance with the relevant requirements of the ICAO.The current focus is still on search and rescue, and collecting evidence for the upcoming accident investigation, said an official of the CAAC at the press conference. For the probe stage, we will invite relevant parties to participate in it in accordance with regulations, said the official.Buttigieg noted that he was very encouraged by the invitation to be on the ground in China. The NTSB, however, later said it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China in light of visa and quarantine requirements, Reuters reported.A spokesperson of China Eastern said at the press conference that the maintenance costs of the carrier in 2021 were increased by 12 percent from 2019, even though the number of flights had decreased due to the epidemic, refuting earlier media reports that the carrier cut its maintenance costs.
