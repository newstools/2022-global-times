Hua Chunying Photo: VCG A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Friday posted on Twitter an 11-point rebuttal to US top diplomat's speech on China, noting that the speech sounded more like a declaration of an all-out strategic competition or war against China despite US' claim of not looking for a Cold War.In the series of posts, Hua Chunying, a spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry, gave strong and specific rebuttal against issues including US' reckless interference in China's internal affairs, US' tariffs on Chinese goods and US' tech blockade against China. Hua's response came after the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered a speech elaborating US' China policy at George Washington University on Thursday.Blinken said the US is "not looking for conflict or a new Cold War." Yet his speech sounded more like a declaration of all-out strategic competition or war against China, read the starter of the 11 tweets from Hua, pointing out the duplicity of Blinken's speech.In response to Blinken's claim to "protect the rights of individuals and sovereign nations," Hua pointed out that the US had, in the last decade alone, invaded and managed regime change in over 20 countries, and gun violence killed about 45,000 American people every year.Slamming Blinken's claim of "the US doesn't seek to block China from its role as a major power," Hua asked why the US has been strengthening the Five Eyes, instead peddling QUAD, putting together AUKUS and enhancing bilateral military alliances in China's neighborhood. "Why the US never stops interfering in China's internal affairs and supporting separatists in Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan?"Rebutting Blinken's claim of not seeking to block China from growing its economy, Hua noted the US still doesn't remove the tariffs from the arbitrary trade war of the Trump administration and spares no efforts to suppress Chinese high-tech firms.Speaking of US' attempt to exclude China from global supply chain and its smearing campaign against China's Xinjiang region, Hua asked why the US is trying to replace China in the global supply chain? Why spread lies such as "security threat" and "forced labor" to deprive Chinese people and companies of the right to develop?In response to Blinken's blaming-shift game against China on its domestic economic problems, Hua pointed out the truth that the tariff war imposed on China by the US costs American companies $1.7 trillion, 240,000 US jobs.On US' "human rights" accusation against China, Hua said Blinken didn't mention the tragedy of Robb Elementary school shooting, which reflects US politicians' indifference, arrogance and inability.On Taiwan question, Hua noted the core and essence of the one-China principle is "one China." There is only one correct version of "one China." There is only one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China.This is the political precondition of the diplomatic relations between China and 181 countries, including the US, Hua noted.In following two posts, Hua pointed out Blinken has been trying carefully to separate the CPC from the Chinese people. She stressed that thanks to the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people are enjoying unprecedented security and happiness and the Chinese children don't have to live in fear of shooting in school and the ethnic minorities don't have to worry they could not breathe like George Floyd .In the last post of the 11 tweets, Hua noted that China is always ready to work toward win-win cooperation, but attaches more importance to deeds than words. China will continue to see whether the US can deliver on their words of "will engage constructively with China and the two great nations can coexist peacefully."Global Times
