Television footage showed flooded roads and submerged cars in Sydney's northern beaches, with residents in low-lying areas told to be ready to evacuate.Amid flash-flooding warnings, authorities asked Sydney's 5 million residents to avoid unnecessary travel on roads and allow plenty of extra travel time for public transport.Reuters
