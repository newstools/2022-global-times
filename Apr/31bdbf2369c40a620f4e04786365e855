All of them have their Shanghai headquarters located in Qingpu district.A number of entities have already applied for a nationally unified pass, or the green pass for cross-provincial vehicles, a key measure to revive cross-provincial logistics transports.According to thepaper.cn, three express delivery companies, including ZTO Express, YTO Express and Yunda have asked eligible vehicles and employees to apply for green pass with the first batch of applications already approved.This came  after STO Express was awarded the first of such passes on April 24 which allowed provincial delivery for critical supplies.Delivery companies are also rolling out more measures to support the delivery personnel and outlets.In order to eliminate the concerns of front-line employees, YTO decided to issue a total of more than 10 million yuan ($1.52 million) in subsistence wages to more than 200 of its outlets in Shanghai.Yunda has also set up a "special anti-epidemic fund" worth 100 million yuan to support franchisees seriously affected by the epidemic.The accelerated resumption of the delivery industry has come after Chinese officials deployed various measures to tackle the logistics problems, including issuing nationally unified vehicle passes and reopening highway toll stations to ensure smooth transportation and support the reopening of express service points so that delivery personnel can return to work in an orderly manner.Among these supportive policies, a total of100 billion yuan relending quota will be issued to support financing for the transportation, logistics and warehousing industries.Global Times
