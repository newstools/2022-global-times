Before the program I never felt excited," Fuseina said.Part of a larger initiative by Roots of Change, under the Britain-based charity Opportunity International, the insurance program uses farmland and crop data collected by the agriculture ministry to help provide cover for about 1,360 farmers in northern Ghana.The Ghana Agricultural Insurance Pool (GAIP), a group of 15 insurance providers, compare data on historical farm yields to actual harvests to verify insurance claims enrolled farmers make.Since it was launched in 2021, the project has paid out 7,000 cedis ($1,120) to more than 300 farmers, according to Ebenezer Laryea, the Ghana head of agricultural businesses at Opportunity International, which pays the farmers' insurance premiums.Some farmers invest the money they get through the program into community savings schemes, where people pool their funds to be used by individual members when they need it."Crop insurance is a game changer," Laryea said, particularly in a country where about half of people make their living from farming.More stable farmingAs temperatures rise in Ghana as a result of climate change, the country's northern region no longer gets two rainy seasons of a few months each but one five-month-long wet season, which can flood fields and drown crops, Laryea said.The rest of the year is dry, leaving crops parched.Food and agriculture minister Owusu Afriyie Akoto has said crop insurance could make farming a more stable livelihood and attract more young people to an occupation now dominated by the aging."It is not just about building resilience against erratic weather but also making agriculture attractive to youth and women by making it a financial asset," he said at the 2021 African Green Revolution Forum in Nairobi.Ghana's Food and Agriculture Ministry did not respond to the Thomson Reuters Foundation's requests for comment.Building trustGAIP first introduced crop insurance to Ghanaian farmers in 2011, but studies show it has been a tough sell.Uptake has been slow in rural areas, mostly due to a lack of understanding of how insurance works, said a study published in June 2021 in the BioMed Central (BMC) journal.It shows 90 percent of small-scale farmers see crop insurance as a useful tool, but less than a fifth said they had signed up for it.Over half of farmers responded that they lacked adequate knowledge about insurance, and about 5 percent said it is too expensive.Another issue was the farmers' lack of trust in how companies calculate insurance payouts.Early crop insurance programs-based payouts on a weather index, with insurance triggered when a preset number of days passed without rain, for instance.But in Ghana and some other parts of Africa weather data is known to be imprecise, said Hedwig Siewertsen, head of inclusive finance at the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), an agricultural nonprofit. xNewer models make the process of calculating crop loss more accurate.In the Roots of Change program, the agriculture ministry uses satellite data to project how much each farmer could produce per acre, then compares that to the actual harvest during a visit to any farm making a claim, said Ibrahim Sulley, an agriculture relationship officer with the social enterprise.The program's officers expect to visit about 335 farms a year to follow up on insurance claims, noted Lydia Baffour Awuah, the Roots of Change senior program manager for Ghana.Sending people to visit farms is more expensive than a weather-index-based insurance model, but the interaction with farmers brings other benefits, backers say.Siewertsen at AGRA said that a face-to-face relationship is vital if insurance is going to gain traction."The main issue in agricultural insurance is gaining the trust of farmers," he said in an email interview. "This can be done through field presence, first to explain how insurance works and second to show that the actual damage is seen and measured," he added.Reuters
