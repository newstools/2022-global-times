CNN reported that the suspect put on a gas mask, deployed a gas canister and then began shooting. The shooter's motive is still unknown."We have always opposed and condemned gun violence, and we extend our condolences to the injured and their families," Zhao said.Incidents like the one in Brooklyn happens a lot in the US, it's part of America's chronic problem of gun violence, Zhao said, noting that gun violence has become a serious human rights disease in American society.Coincidentally, the same day the shooting happened, the US State Department released its annual human rights report, pointing fingers at other countries over human rights situations, but said nothing for its deteriorating human rights situation, systemic racism and gun violence, Zhao said. Aren't the lives and safety of its people worth of the US' concern? Zhao asked, saying the US has become a nation of gun violence.We sincerely hope that tragedies like the Brooklyn subway shooting will never happen again, and that the American people will live a life free of shootings, fear and discrimination,Zhao said.The US government should stop pointing fingers at other countries' human rights situations and do something concrete to solve its own problems, Zhao said.Global Times
