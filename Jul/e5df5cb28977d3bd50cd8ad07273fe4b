It has made due contributions to the national strategy and promotion of the construction of major engineering projects. In its major hydropower projects in Xizang, it has ranked top in four aspects of the hydropower industry, including the depth of overburden drilling, vertical drilling depth, drilling of large diameter and horizontal drilling depth. Global Times
