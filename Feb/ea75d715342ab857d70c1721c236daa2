The painting by Fan, son of renowned painter Fan Zeng, will go on display at the embassy together with works from Chinese artists Zhao Woki and Chu Teh-chun, acting as a cultural bridge between the two countries. According to the artist, the painting marks Fan's artistic pursuit of the Peach Blossom Spring, an ethereal utopia where the people lead an ideal existence in harmony with nature. The utopian village became a symbol for peace of mind among scholars and artists after it appeared in the poem of the same name by the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) poet Tao Yuanming. "The real Peach Blossom Spring is the Peach Blossom Spring of the soul, the freedom of the soul and the tranquility of returning to nature," said Fan.The painting not only allows more people to appreciate the charm of traditional Chinese culture, but also reveals the importance of the harmonious coexistence between man and Nature in Chinese culture.
