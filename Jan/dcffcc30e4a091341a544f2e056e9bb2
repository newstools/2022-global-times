In all, 256,142 hectares have been set aside for the project. Early plans for the new capital depict a utopian design aimed at creating an environmentally friendly "smart" city, but few details have been confirmed. Environmentalist critics of the capital's move have warned it could damage ecosystems in the region, where mining and palm oil plantations already threaten rainforests that are home to Borneo's endangered species.On Monday, Widodo said the new capital would be one "where the people are close from any destination, where they can bike and walk everywhere because there are zero emissions.""This [capital] will not only have government offices, we want to build a new smart metropolis that can be a magnet for global talent and a center of innovation," he said in a speech."Nusantara," which means "archipelago," was chosen from a list of 80 names because it was widely recognizable by Indonesians and easy to memorize, the nation's development minister, Suharso Monoarfa, said Monday. Indonesia is not the first country in the region to relocate from an overpopulated capital.Malaysia moved its government to Putrajaya from Kuala Lumpur in 2003, while Myanmar moved its capital to Naypyidaw from Rangoon in 2006.AFP
