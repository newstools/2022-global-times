Britain pledged 88 million pounds($115 million).Yemen has been mired in violence since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government from the capital, Sanaa, prompting a coalition led by Saudi Arabia to intervene.Aid agencies have already been forced to cut back or stop food, health and other vital assistance in Yemen where the economy and basic services have collapsed.Access to potable water for 4 million people living in major cities may be lost in coming weeks and women may lose healthcare services, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said."We cannot cut people adrift from humanitarian aid," he warned.Food prices, which doubled in 2021 due to a coalition blockade on Houthi-held areas, are set to rise further since a third of the country's wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine.Across Yemen, 2.2 million children are acutely malnourished.In Aden's Keraa camp, Abdo Yehya has seen no aid in 2022."We survive with the help of our son who collects empty plastic bottles and metal cans and sells them, and ... the kindness of people," he said. "We are exhausted."The World Food Programme warned on Monday that without substantial new funding mass starvation and famine would follow.Donor budgets have been strained by the pandemic. There are also concerns over allegations of Houthi interference in aid flows. The Houthis previously told Human Rights Watch the allegations were "baseless."UAE Foreign Affairs Minister of State Sheikh Shakhboot al-Nahyan accused the Houthis of diverting aid and urged them to engage in peace negotiations.The Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council plans to invite Yemeni parties for consultations in Riyadh starting in March in support of UN-led peace efforts. Reuters
