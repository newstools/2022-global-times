The city reported 1,015 confirmed and 22,609 asymptomatic domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases on the day, a new record. Nio delivered 25,768 vehicles in the first three months of this year, up 29 percent year-on-year, according to industry data. Industry data show that Shanghai is home to the country's greatest number of EV-related companies, totaling 18,200, according to industry outlet autohome.com.cnGlobal Times
