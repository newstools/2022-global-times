It can contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics in future.Conducted by research teams from the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Fudan University, the research has been published in the material science academic journal Advanced Materials.According to the research, the MFSN can achieve human-like multisensory perception, which helps people ascertain the properties of objects and make accurate judgments. The findings can be used for practical applications, further enabling the building of multimodal sensory systems and contributing to the development of highly intelligent robotics in the future.Global Times
