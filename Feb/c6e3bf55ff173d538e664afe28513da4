Some countries attempted to incite a new round of tension with China and stir up new trouble on Tuesday, one year after Canada rounded up a small number of countries to issue a joint declaration on February 15, 2021 against so-called China's "arbitrary detention,” the Global Times has learned. When Canada gathered some other countries to make the declaration, which attacked China on the case of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, several US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, voiced support for this declaration.Canada's declaration confuses right from wrong, making unfounded countercharges. China is a law-based country, and those two Canadians committed crimes that endanger China's national security, and that their arrests were in accordance with the law, according to experts.On the other hand, Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, who did not breach any Canadian laws, for more than 1,000 days, which actually constitutes arbitrary detention.Analysts pointed out that the US has its ugly history in arbitrary detention. Many innocent immigrants were detained in the US, which resulted in separation between parents and children, and the breakdown of many families. Outside the US, the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison is just a minor piece of the US' many secret prisons worldwide, public information showed. According to research carried out by a British human rights group, the US may have used as many as 17 ships as "floating prisons" since 2001. Detainees are interrogated aboard the vessels and then rendered to other, often undisclosed, locations, it is claimed.After launching the Afghan war, the US set up many secret jails and exercised atrocities within Afghanistan and ally countries, and murdered Iraq civilians when invading the country. The prisoner abuse and torture in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison also sent a chilling effect across the world.The US is making irresponsible remarks and randomly attacking other countries on the ground of "arbitrary detention" which only triggers discussions about its own scandals, said experts.They also warned that the US attempt to fabricate facts and smear China won't achieve its goal, and seeking to crack down on China with such means is also a dead end.
