Who knew that grocery shopping could be so romantic? An Italian man in Venice proposed to his girlfriend at a grocery store this week, asking her to marry him using the checkout counter's microphone."My love, I wanted to ask you something, in front of everyone," Salvatore Costarelli is seen saying into a microphone, in a video published on the website of the Corriere del Veneto newspaper. "I love you, you're my life, and I want to ask you, will you marry me?" he adds. Someone off-camera begins clapping and the camera pans to the detergent aisle where a woman, Tiziana Famao, is seen leaning over her cart in surprise before wheeling it out bashfully. The couple hug next to the frozen vegetables, a ring is unearthed from Costarelli's pocket and placed on Famao's finger, and a long kiss is accompanied by laughter and applause from the cashiers.
