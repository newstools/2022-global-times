Oscars phtoo:VCGMarch's Oscars will include a new "fan favorite" prize for 2021's most popular film as voted for by Twitter users, organizers said Monday, seeking to lure viewers back to a ceremony that has seen audiences plummet.The announcement - which will be made during the 94th Academy Awards telecast on March 27 - comes after several crowd-pleasing blockbusters including Spider-Man: No Way Home and No Time To Die failed to earn Oscar nominations in major categories, including best picture.Their omission raised fears that many movie fans will skip the show. But any film released in 2021 can be voted for in the new category using the Twitter hashtag #OscarsFanFavorite or via the Academy's website, raising the chances of a blockbuster being honored on the night.Television ratings for the Oscars have dramatically declined in recent years. In 2021's edition, which honored mainly smaller, arthouse movies such as best picture winner Nomadland, was watched by just over 10 million viewers - a 56 percent decline from 2020, which was already a record low.As Oscars voters have increasingly drifted away from more mainstream fare, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has toyed with various reforms to boost the ceremony's popularity.In 2018, organizers proposed a "popular film" Oscar to honor blockbuster movies such as the Star War films or Marvel superhero films that rake in millions at the box office.But it swiftly shelved those plans after critics ridiculed the move, and the new "fan favorite" award will not be a formal Oscar category. Meryl Johnson, the Academy's vice president of digital marketing, said the move would "help build an engaged and excited digital audience leading up to this year's ceremony" and allow fans to "engage with the show in real-time, find a community and be a part of the experience in ways they've never been able to before."
