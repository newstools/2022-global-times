The companies and people involved have been punished.The number of infections reported in Shanghai have been on a downward trend in recent days, Yuan said.From July 3 to Saturday, 11 new infections were found outside of the control areas, and related data tracking and testing has already started, Zhao Dandan, deputy director of Shanghai Municipal Health Commission said at the press conference on Saturday. Global Times
