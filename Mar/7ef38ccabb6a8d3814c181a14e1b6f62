It needs to undertake more test flights under different environments and is likely to receive more modifications if the hydrogen-powered variant is ready for operation, the expert said.China has a lot of new technologies under development for drones, and it is worth observing which ones will eventually be used on a large scale, which involves many factors including mission requirements, reliability and affordability, the expert noted.
