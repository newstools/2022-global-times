Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian Photo: fmprc.gov.cn Disseminating false news about China in a bid to divert attention from the international community is the US playing its old trick of "a thief crying 'Stop thief!'" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said at Wednesday's press conference in response to US media reports that accused China of launching cyberattacks, citing cyber security companies.Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the US act of calling "a thief crying 'Stop thief'" won't succeed. China firmly opposes and cracks down on any form of hacking, and will not encourage, support or connive at cyberattacks, Zhao said. The recent reports made by Chinese security companies by Qi An Pangu lab and internet security company 360 found hackers affiliated with the US' National Security Agency (NSA) have been launching cyberattacks against nearly 50 countries and regions for a decade. Such act severely harms China's key infrastructure, safety of large amounts of personal data, commercial and technological secrets, also impacts China-US mutual trust in cyber space, Zhao said. The US did not make any explanation over it, Zhao added. An elite hacking group under the US NSA was found to have been creating an advanced and covert backdoor which has been used to monitor 45 countries and regions for over a decade, Qi An Pangu lab told the Global Times. The 360 report received by the Global Times showed that the NSA has been launching cyberattacks against 47 countries and regions for a decade, with Chinese government departments, high-tech companies and military-related institutes among the key targets. Global Times
