Wellington Koo, a member of the Chinese delegation to the Versailles Conference in France. He gave an eloquent speech at the meeting, refuting the unreasonable demands of Japan and demanding the return of the territory in East China's Shandong Province that Japan had seized from Germany during World War I.A Youku representative told the Global Times that the company wanted to contribute to the protection of classic film and television works by producing the 4K restoration while also paying tribute to the May Fourth Movement and the young people who worked hard to contribute to society.Besides the domestic film, some classic foreign language films are also streaming 4k restoration versions such as Forrest Gump and The Chorus, about young people pursing their dreams.Most of these restored film and television works were shot on movies made more than a decade or two ago, leading to noise, scratches and even fading to appear on screen. Thanks to the AI repair technology, self-supervised models and high-definition face repair models, audiences can now see the details of the characters on screen with high clarity.More importantly, compared with manual restoration, digital restoration only takes six times the length of the movie to complete, which means that a two-hour-long movie can be restored in 12 hours, according to the press release.
