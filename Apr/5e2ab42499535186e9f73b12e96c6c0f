Australian troops achieved a breakthrough in Villers-Bretonneux when they pulled off a major counter-offensive against German troops alongside British and French forces.The audacious operation stopped a German advance that would have otherwise swept on to nearby Amiens, a strategic city for allied forces.AFP
