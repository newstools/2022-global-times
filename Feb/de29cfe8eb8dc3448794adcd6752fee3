I know it hasn't always been easy ... But together we have, and we continue to, overcome."Health ministry data show 93 percent of those eligible above the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated and 49 percent of eligible adults have received a booster shot, but infections keep rising. On Sunday, there were 208 new community cases, following a record 243 the previous day.Waitangi Day is named for the region on the North Island where representatives of the British Crown and more than 500 indigenous Maori chiefs signed a founding treaty in 1840.Maori, who account for about 15 percent of New Zealand's population, were dispossessed of much of their land during British colonization. In years past, many would protest on the Waitangi Day for civil and social rights, criticizing successive governments for not doing enough.In December, Ardern's government set up the Maori Health Authority to ensure better health access to Maori."We have an obligation to make sure everyone has access to the healthcare they need, and that you don't die younger than everyone else in New Zealand because you are Maori," Ardern said on Sunday.Reuters
