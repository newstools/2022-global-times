It said on Wednesday that the industry should strengthen training and qualification management of key professional positions such as flight, air traffic control and maintenance, and those small carriers and airports which have not yet reached best practice are also a key focus for ensuring safety. The meeting also vowed to strengthen basic research on real-time monitoring, early warning and decision-making assistance technologies for aviation safety risks as well. The aviation industry has held a two-week long safety review, and CAAC said it has rectified a number of safety hazards.From March 29 to April 1, the supervision team under the CAAC carried out safety inspections in seven regions across the nation, and has raised specific rectification requirements addressing operations, professional team building and safety insurance. Currently, major onsite investigations for crashed flight MU5735 have been completed, while decoding of the aircraft’s two black boxes is still underway.Chinese officials confirmed the preliminary investigation report will be completed within 30 days of the incident.Global Times
