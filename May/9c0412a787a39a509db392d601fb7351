Courtesy of Liu PeiwenOn the third floor of Tianjin Binhai Art Museum, a new solo exhibition is displaying 166 of Chinese artist Qu Jianxiong's latest ink wash works. The Cinema exhibition takes a movie theater as a theme. Entering the exhibition hall, visitors will have the opportunity to view an impressively large ink wash installation 30 meters long and 7.5 meters wide at one end. On the chairs placed in the exhibition hall, more than 100 ink paintings sit quietly like "movie audiences" facing this screen. Additionally, a Light-light video installation some 8.5 meters long and 16 meters wide is on display during the exhibition cycle.Liu Peiwen, director of exhibition, says that through the narrative perspective of cinema, the exhibition presents a complex microcosm of contemporary society, focusing on issues that we may encounter in life. "When walking into the 'cinema' in the art museum, we seem to enter a familiar but unfamiliar territory. We naturally immerse ourselves in the story of the cinema and enter the world of 'people' in the story through the light. The artist expresses his feeling of the current public space with ink works and the concept of space. This is not a standard art exhibition. All the artists and curators can do is to enter such a 'cinema' with the audience," noted Liu.Global Times
