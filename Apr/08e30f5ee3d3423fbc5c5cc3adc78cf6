It's not surprising at all to hear their curse, smear and sneer," said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday.In response to the taunt of Taiwan pro-secessionists media on Taiwan-born workout livestreamer Liu Genghong, 50, who has driven a workout fad across China, Ma said no one can halt the unstoppable and public-supportive trend of the intimacy of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The workout fad perfectly shows that the internet and new media have provided convenient channels and platforms for compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to exchange and understand each other amid the COVID-19 epidemic, Ma said. Based on blood connection, such exchanges meet the common interest of people on both the mainland and the island, and will bring more and more tangible benefits to people in the Taiwanese region, Ma added.Liu's livestreaming workouts recently blew up Chinese social media, where Liu encouraged millions of online viewers to join with him and his wife. With his energetic and cheerful livestreaming, Liu has accumulated more than 40 million followers on Douyin and Xiaohongshu, with up to a million views per session.
