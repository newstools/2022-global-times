On Sunday she was greeted by huge cheers, trumpets and a rendition of the national anthem before retreating inside.Wearing bright green, the queen smiled and waved as she appeared alongside son and heir Charles, grandson William and his eldest child, George. Charles' wife Camilla, William's wife Kate and their two younger children made up the unusually small family group on the balcony."I have been humbled and deeply touched that so many people have taken to the streets to celebrate my Platinum Jubilee," she said. "While I may not have attended every event in person, my heart has been with you all; and I remain committed to serving you to the best of my ability, supported by my family."The queen was forced to miss some of the events because of discomfort while traveling and activity they required, the palace has said, issues that have recently caused her to cancel a number of engagements.She has reigned longer than any of her predecessors, ascending to the throne in 1952, aged just 25, inheriting dominion over a Britain still emerging from the ravages of World War II and with Winston Churchill as prime minister.The appearance on the balcony capped the final day of the national celebration, with a colorful and eccentric pageant making its way through London, with military bands, vintage cars, dancers and celebrities parading through the streets.The Gold State Coach that carried the queen to Westminster Abbey to be crowned in 1953 formed part of the pageant, seen in public again for the first time in 20 years.Representatives from Britain's diverse communities, and across the Commonwealth, danced and marched through the streets, while other performers dressed as animals, nuns, cake stands and people from every decade of the queen's reign.Once the pageant came to an end, crowds surged up the Mall grand boulevard to stand before Buckingham Palace and wave Union flags. Singer Ed Sheeran also performed. Once the queen moved back inside, the cast of "Mamma Mia" broke out into a performance of "Dancing Queen" on the stage.Reuters
