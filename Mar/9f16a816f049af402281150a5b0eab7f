They were not known to the authorities for similar acts.Chief prosecutor Christian Henry said the two were coming from a nightclub "and had just dropped off another person just before the events."Blood test results were expected on Monday and "will allow us to say if they have consumed drugs," he told RTBF news. "Nothing goes in the direction of radicalism or extremism," he said."The facts have been qualified as murder but we will see what the investigation will reveal and if we should requalify the thing as manslaughter," he added.Belgian towns and villages host many street carnivals around the season of Lent, with the parades in Binche and Aalst the best known internationally. Like Binche, the carnival of Strepy-Bracquegnies involves participants dressed up as "Gilles," extravagantly attired comical figures who are "called out" to the parade in the early hours.AFP
