China is seeking to maintain stability in the property market this year after the roller coaster ride of 2016, with measures to prevent surges in metropolises and the growing inventories in small cities.File photo:XinhuaChina's new home prices continued to rise in February, but the growth slowed after a small gain during the previous month, highlighting still sluggish demand that needs to be further stimulated, officials and experts said on Wednesday. In February, new home prices in first-tier cities rose 0.5 percent, 0.1 percentage points lower than the previous month. Among them, prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou increased 0.6 percent, 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, with all rates slowing compared with January, data revealed by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday showed.New house prices in second-tier cities were flat, compared with a 0.1-percent increase in the previous month, while in third-tier cities, prices fell 0.3 percent, compared with the 0.2-percent decrease in January.Prices for secondhand homes in first-tier cities rose 0.5 percent, with the growth picking up 0.4 percentage points compared with the previous month, while prices in second-tier cities fell 0.3 percent month-on-month and those in third-tier cities declined 0.4 percent.Sheng Guoqing, chief statistician from the urban department of the NBS, said that in February, among 70 large and medium-sized cities, 40 saw new home prices fall, one more than in the previous month, while 57 cities recorded a price drop for secondhand homes, two more than in January."Despite continued gains in February, it's still hard for new home prices to rise, as demand needs to be further stimulated, and there is resistance to a market rebound," Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that authorities should focus on the rapid cooling in third-tier cities, which can easily affect local land transactions and market expectations.On March 11, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said that in February, China's household loans decreased by 336.9 billion yuan ($43.07 billion), which reflected a lack of willingness among buyers to enter the market, analysts noted.Experts also attributed the resurgence of the Omicron variant in many places across the country to the slowdown of new home price growth, as it may curb demand.Chinese regulators have implemented a series of measures to support the housing market, including reducing the down payment ratio and lowering the housing loan interest rate for first-time buyers in some cities.  The State Council's Financial Stability and Development Committee said on Wednesday that real estate enterprises should put forward a strong and effective response program for the prevention and mitigation of risk, as well as supporting measures for the transformation to a new development model.Yan said that he is optimistic about the recovery of the property market. "The market is expected to stabilize in March with the continuous release of favorable regulations," Yan noted.
