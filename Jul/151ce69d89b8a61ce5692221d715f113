China will also support India in hosting the G20 summit and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO in 2023.Both China and India adhere to the overall direction of multilateralism and they share many common propositions in safeguarding peace and security, promoting economic recovery, improving global governance and working together to fight against COVID-19, Wang said, noting that the two countries should step up coordination and cooperation to promote more democratic international relations and a fairer international order, making the growing voices of developing countries to be heard and their legitimate interests better safeguarded.Jaishankar said that both sides have made positive progress in maintaining border stability, promoting practical cooperation and facilitating people-to-people exchanges since his meeting with Wang in March.According to Jaishankar, India looks forward to a positive, cooperative and constructive relationship with China and it is ready to work with China to send a clear message to the outside world, to speed up the process to improve relations, and to turn the consensus and visions of the two countries' leaders into reality.India thanked China for supporting its hosting of the G20 and SCO next year and will continue to adhere to strategic independence and an independent stance in international affairs.Global Times
