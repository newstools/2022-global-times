Lancang River in Southwest China's Yunnan Photo: VCGThe US-funded platform "Mekong Dam Monitor (MDM)" corrected its released data errors on water level readings of Chinese reservoirs on upstream Mekong River, which is called the Lancang River in China, soon after the Global Times' report on Wednesday, citing the Chinese scientists pointed out its serious flaws.Chinese hydrological experts from Tsinghua University discovered that the reservoir level readings released by MDM contained serious errors and differed significantly from the actual gauge, which can easily be misused in the hyping of Chinese dams "controlling water" and "hurting downstream countries." MDM monitored the hydrological and climactic information of all China's 11 dams on the Lancang  mainstream from December of 2020. Observers said errors were partly caused by backward tools and backdoor political considerations.In its latest Facebook post on Wednesday, the MDM recognized some errors, including a serious "typo" in their data, and made corrections after their double check using a high-resolution satellite imagery from a professional platform Planet Labs.

The impacts for some downstream countries are obvious and worrisome," said the research team.Despite of significant partial deviation, the revised MDM's data can reflect the rough overall trend of Xiaowan Reservoir's water level changes, as the MDM said.MDM calls for Chinese scientists to share more information about Lancang reservoir levels in its Facebook post, but actually China has published its reservoirs' daily overall water release to downstream since November 2020, and has insisted on reporting annual water discharge and relevant hydrological information to riparian countries.China and countries of the lower Mekong River have teamed up for their largest joint study on hydrological and climate changes, to find out best solutions to cope with the increasing natural threats. In September 2021, the Mekong River Commission -an intergovernmental body comprising Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam -announced a three-year study spanning the entire river basin, in tandem with Myanmar and the China-led Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Water Center, VOA reported.
