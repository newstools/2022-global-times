Photo: VCGChinese 17-year-old snowboarder Su Yiming made history by winning a silver medal in the men's slopestyle final with 88.70 points at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on Monday.Su scored the best result in the history of the slopestyle competition for the Chinese team by winning the silver medal. It was also the second medal for China at the Beijing Winter Olympics.The General Administration of Sport sent congratulations to Su and his team for making breakthroughs in this field.Su, who will turn 18 in a few days, said before the games, "I hope I can win a medal as a coming-of-age gift."Su was the youngest snowboarder to compete in the men's slopestyle final, which was held at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou, North China's Hebei Province on Monday. He was also the last to compete in the first round of the final, based on the reverse order of the qualifying results.The 17-year-old athlete has already made history by becoming the first Chinese player to advance to the final of the slopestyle competition after being ranked first in the previous qualification round.Su put in a brilliant performance in the final, scoring 88.70 points in the second of his three runs.Although Su excelled in several difficult moves in the first round, the judges only gave him 78.38 points, which led some to question the fairness of the judges' scoring, but the incident did not stop the young athlete from performing better.Canada's Maxence Parrot, the Pyeongchang Olympic silver medalist, won gold with a score of 90.96 points in the second round of the final.Besides the slopestyle, Su will also compete in the big air completion, whose qualification runs will be held on February 14, with the finals one day later.
