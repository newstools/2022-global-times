In November 2021, Xi signed a new set of regulations on military equipment procurement focusing on war preparedness and combat capabilities.  During a military conference on weaponry and equipment-related work in October 2021 in Beijing, Xi urged efforts to break new ground in the development of the country's military weaponry and equipment, and contribute to the realization of the goals set for the centennial of the PLA in 2027.China aims to basically complete the modernization of national defense and armed forces by 2035 and fully transform the PLA into a world-class military by the middle of the century, Xinhua reported.China pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature, and its military equipment development also follows that policy, analysts said.
