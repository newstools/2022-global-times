Paris remembers and will always stand by the victims and their families."Arthur Denouveaux, a survivor of the Bataclan attack, where 90 people died, called it a fair ruling. "It will help us," Denouveaux, who heads a victims' association, told Reuters.A defiant Abdeslam had said at the start of the trial that he was a "soldier" of the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks.He later apologized to the victims and said during the trial that he had chosen at the last minute not to detonate his explosive vest. But, based on the investigations and hearings, the court ruled otherwise."The court considered that the explosive vest malfunctioned," judge Jean-Louis Peries said. Reuters
