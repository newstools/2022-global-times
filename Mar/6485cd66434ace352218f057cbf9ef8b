In 2021, container traffic through Ukraine only accounted for 2 percent of the westbound China-Europe freight trains.Some changes in routes have also been adopted to minimize the impact. For example, the Ukraine Southern Line was temporarily rerouted to the Polish Northern Line that connects the Alashankou Port, in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, to Malaszewicze in Belarus, and Budapest, Hungary.The situation in Russia and Ukraine still brings some risks to the cross-border trains. Feng said that the situation in Ukraine and Russia has caused many exporters, especially "cash-on-delivery" companies, to stop shipping to Russia, Ukraine, and many other parts of Europe and Central Asia. Some even cancelled the planned shipping schedule, he said.With the unclear situation in Ukraine and the widening sanctions from the West, some industry insiders are preparing for the worse.Data show that Russia is indispensable and a key part of freight train services.If the West continues to widen sanctions, Feng said that the freight settlement channel and settlement system between China and Russia will be threatened first. "At present, freight is denominated in dollars [...] If the West cuts off Russia's intermediate settlement channel in the international financial system, it means that the settlement system for freight charges between China and Russia will not be able to proceed normally," Feng said, suggesting a discussion of contingency plans for direct settlements.
