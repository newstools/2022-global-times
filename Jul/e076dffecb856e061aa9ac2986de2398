Editor's Note:Known as the "Western Regions" in ancient times, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is located on the famous "Silk Road" which connected ancient China with the rest of the world, making it a gathering point for different civilizations.The Xinjiang Museum is an art palace that collects Xinjiang's historical and cultural artifacts and displays unique cultural features of the region. When visiting the museum on Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that Chinese civilization is extensive and profound, has a long history stretching back to antiquity, and is composed of outstanding cultures of all its ethnic groups.He added that we should make full and effective use of historical facts, archaeological objects, and cultural heritage on the exchanges between various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, to prove that this region, inhabited by many ethnic groups, has been an integral part of China since the ancient times, and that various ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been important members of the big Chinese family in weal and woe. Opening the museum's door, we can start a cultural journey and appreciate the blossoms from different civilizations blooming in Xinjiang.
