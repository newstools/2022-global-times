Two children from one family tested positive for COVID-19 in the preliminary screening in Chaoyang district of Beijing on Monday. Their residential community was put under closed-loop management starting from Tuesday, according to local authorities. Another two family members were also confirmed as COVID-19 patients — one is the children's mother and the other is the children's grandmother. The grandmother returned to Beijing from outside the city on February 28, and the original place she lived was classified as medium-risk for COVID-19, according to the authorities.
