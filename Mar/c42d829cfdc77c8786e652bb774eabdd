"Anyway, it's worth waiting because the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics was a big and successful sports event in our home country as it brought peace, unity and hope to people from all over the world despite the pandemic, so I want to own a souvenir to commemorate the moment." Bing Dwen Dwen, the cuddly mascot for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, shot to fame on Chinese social media during the 16-day Games. The mascot became so popular that all related products, including Bing Dwen Dwen miniatures, dolls and keychains, sold by licensed online retailers and physical stores, were almost sold out within a short time.
