"We all have our own script, which is life, and we need to be the captain of our own ship."Impressed by the jokes and rich storyline in the movie, many reviewers praised it after test screenings across the country. "This is a movie worth watching with the family during Spring Festival, as the story gives a full description of what family love is," said one reviewer on social media."I think Wei Chenggong can refer to every ordinary person who is making an effort to get by while chasing their dreams. We might be small people but we get stronger when we're trying to reach our dreams," said another.
