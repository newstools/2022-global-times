It is currently in the midst of its sixth cycle, known as AR6.Each research cycle can take years, with the main reports released in stages, often in the run-up to key UN climate change negotiations.There are also "special" reports, such as one in 2018 on the importance of keeping global warming to an internationally agreed lower limit of 1.5 C and another on how changing uses of land affect climate change.Besides February's adaptation report, two further reports are due in 2022.April's will look at ways to reduce emissions to meet the Paris Agreement warming goals. A final report in the cycle, planned for late September, will summarize the whole series ahead of November's annual UN climate conference.What's new about this adaptation report?Many previous IPCC reports have addressed how to better protect people from growing climate-change impacts by adapting how - and even where - they live and work.But as it warns about the ways global warming is turbo-charging droughts, floods, storms, heat waves and sea level rise, this report will also have a bigger focus on solutions.That is designed both to spur swift action toward adopting those solutions and to curb fears that the battle against climate change is becoming hopeless."The growth in climate impacts is far outpacing our efforts to adapt to them," UNEP chief Inger Andersen warned in February. She urged nations, cities, businesses and individuals to turn adaptation efforts "into a sprint."Adaptation measures include everything from growing hardier crops to building higher sea walls and stronger homes, restoring flood-absorbing wetlands, planting cooling urban forests and relocating whole communities from eroding coastlines or unstable mountain slopes.In another shift, the report will make clearer the link between the health and well-being of nature and of people, noting how functioning ecosystems provide the clean air, water, food and carbon storage people rely on, said co-chair Hans-Otto Portner.Natural systems have so-called "hard limits," beyond which they will struggle to function properly, leading to problems from declining fish stocks to less capacity to suck carbon dioxide from the air.People also face such limits, as climate change threatens to make some parts of the globe too hot or dry to inhabit, which could drive communities from their homes, noted Portner.How will the IPCC report affect real-world climate action?The two scientists leading work on the adaptation report said they hope the findings will help fill key gaps both in public understanding about climate change and its risks, and in implementation of adaptation measures.The report will show how accelerating planetary heating is compounding risks and making it harder to achieve the globally agreed "Sustainable Development Goals" by their 2030 deadline.Reuters
