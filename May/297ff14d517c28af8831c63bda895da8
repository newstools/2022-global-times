(Xinhua/Xu Jinquan)China has shown tactical resilience in maintaining flexible supply chains as the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted businesses and policymakers across the globe to rethink supply chain planning, an executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF) said on Thursday, urging increased cooperation for trade liberalization to address the ramifications of global supply chain disruptions.

Also, they have led to some new investment in order to respond to the disruptions, Doherty reckoned.The pandemic has resulted in a "heightened awareness among many businesses and policymakers of the value of having a real resilience mindset," he said, noting that the disruptions may spur growth in non-traditional sources and locations, particularly in developing countries.When asked about workable fixes for insufficient cooperation in the haze of geopolitical tensions that could have amplified supply chain woes, Doherty urged a more decisive endeavor across the globe to push for trade liberalization so as to address some of the ramifications of supply chain disruptions."We [ought to] remove some of the tariffs that have been put in place and recognize that this is a way to fight against some of the inflation pressures we see," he said.Furthermore, efforts could be in the pipeline to double down on practical responses available that can make trade easier, he continued."Even if we don't come to formal intergovernmental agreements on issues, there's still a lot that can be done in terms of reducing some of the paperwork and reducing the barriers in streamlining trade flows," the WEF executive remarked.He called for ramped-up digitalization to cut through the paper-heavy process within trade financing chains or just getting goods to borders. Describing China as a role model in facilitating trade domestically and a leading power in the WTO's investment facilitation discussions, Doherty was hoping for the country to share its experience with the rest of the world, developing countries in particular."If China can continue on that course… and help with the implementation of [such] reforms in its neighborhood, and then the other parts of the world. I think we'll be doing a great service" in enabling supply chain resilience globally, he said.
