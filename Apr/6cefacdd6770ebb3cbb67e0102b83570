Photo:XinhuaAs Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu, crew of the Shenzhou-13 mission, have completed exactly 180 days working and living inside China's orbiting Tianhe space station core module on Thursday, many are counting the hours for their glorious return to Earth after a six-month mission, the longest in the country's aerospace history.Although the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) has yet to update the schedule for the mid-April return and disclose the exact timeline for the detachment of the Shenzhou-13 manned spacecraft from the Tianhe, many space observers are looking at Saturday morning, around 10 am, when the Tianhe core module would fly over the Dongfeng landing site in the Gobi Desert, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The site has designated to receive the heroes and such window would open again a couple of days after that.The Shenzhou-13 crew has completed all planned tasks in orbit and will detach from the Tianhe core module soon to head to the designated Dongfeng landing site, the CMSA updated on late Thursday night. The crew has made thorough preparations for their departure and the Dongfeng landing site, as well as relevant departments on the ground, are making final preparations, it said.The search and rescue teams at the Dongfeng landing site said they were already making preparations to receive the Shenzhou-13 crew by mid-April. They have been carrying out tasks like closely monitoring the weather conditions in the area and constructing systems for tracking and monitoring the flight of the spacecraft, read the latest posts by the Dongfeng site on its official WeChat public account this week."Please rest assured, the well-geared and effectively trained ground and air units would be there once the return capsule touches down," the search and rescue teams vowed in one post on Wednesday.Ahead of the Shenzhou-13 return, Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping, during an inspection tour on Tuesday, demanded efforts to upgrade the spacecraft launch site in South China's island province of Hainan with world-leading standards.Xi, also General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site. He extended his greetings to all the staff stationed at the site and asked them to shoulder their responsibility and be brave to innovate and make new breakthroughs.After being briefed on the launch site, Xi inspected the launching tower and other facilities. He spoke highly of a series of key space missions launched from the site, including the launching of the space station core module Tianhe, the Chang'e-5 lunar mission, and the Tianwen-1 Mars probe.Xi noted that Wenchang is the launch site of China's new-generation high thrust carrier rockets and the bridgehead of the country's deep space exploration.The launch site should continue to eye the frontier of global space development and the major strategic needs of China's space industry, and comprehensively improve its modern space launch capabilities, said Xi.Xi mentioned that Wenchang staff should carefully prepare, coordinate and implement the tasks to ensure the success of missions, and take practical actions to welcome the victory of the Party's 20th National Congress.As the youngest member of China's spacecraft launch centers, the Wenchang spaceport successfully completed its first launch mission on June 25, 2016, with the maiden flight of China's Long March-7 carrier rocket. On November 3, 2016, the Long March-5 also took its first flight from the Hainan launch site.Staff at the Wenchang spaceport reached by the Global Times said they were greatly encouraged and inspired by the speech from the top leader and vowed to ensure the execution of future missions and contribute their wisdom and strength to making China a space power.Dubbed the "home port for China's space station building missions," Wenchang was the launching site of the Tianhe core module, the Tianzhou-2 and the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecrafts on April 29, 2021, May 29, 2021, and September 20, 2021, respectively.On Monday, ahead of Xi's visit, the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft and the Long March-7 Y5 rocket commissioned for the launch mission arrived safely. The next launch is expected to be a third supply run to the Tianhe core module after the return of the crew of the Shenzhou-13.More than six monthsThe Shenzhou-13 trio of taikonauts, under the command of Zhai Zhigang, was launched to space with a Long March-2F Y13 rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on October 16. They were scheduled to break the record of longest in-orbit stay for a single spaceflight mission in the country's space history with six months. Now, they have pulled that off.The length of stay and their physical and psychological conditions in orbit have effectively verified the capability to stay in China's space station in the long term and this is another achievement that suggests China has become a strong space power, Song Zhongping, a space analyst and TV commentator, told the Global Times.The taikonauts of the Shenzhou-13 have executed two successful spacewalks with Wang Yaping, becoming the first Chinese woman in history to perform this maneuver.The crew has also delivered two Tiangong Classroom science lectures for students on Earth, connecting with youth from Beijing, Hong Kong, Macao, and Xinjiang and Xizang autonomous regions.They have also played a significant part in many historic moments in China in the past six months, sending their heavenly blessings and congratulations during the Chinese New Year and joining the audience of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games from space.The crew completed more than 20 scientific experiments in orbit focused on new technologies to monitor the taikonauts' wellbeing in space, innovation and new discoveries as well as data collection.These studies will give us a better understanding of how the weightless environment impacts human beings, and also provide a great experiment model to contribute to the study of general public health issues such as aging and the occurrence of heart diseases, said Li Yinghui, deputy chief designer of the country's taikonaut system.Experts noted that six months is an international standard for the duration of stays. However, China is not competing and has never sought to compete with other space powers in this regard. As long as the station is properly attended and the goal of the mission is met, the duration does not matter, and taikonauts can take shifts to allow more people in the candidate pool to have a chance, as well as ensuring the health and safety of taikonauts in orbit, Song said.Pang Zhihao, a senior space expert, hailed that the average length of orbital stay for the astronauts of the International Space Station is also about six months and China could reach this level as soon as in the second mission to the country's own space station, which is a great achievement.Analysts said the successful execution of the first six-month mission has laid a great foundation for the future manned missions which would allow more room for imagination that amateur taikonauts, such as flight engineers, space scientists and even foreign astronauts, would have no problem living and working in China's space station once it is fully completed.Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov recently said in an interview that China's space program is "good and fast," and that China "knows how to do things" when it comes to manned spaceflight. He and other colleagues are willing to participate in China's space programs if China allows it, be it near-Earth orbit missions or deep-space explorations to the Moon and Mars.Shao Limin, deputy technology manager of manned spaceship systems, told the Global Times that the Shenzhou-13 spacecraft will fly five orbits before returning to Earth, which is 13 orbits less than the Shenzhou-12 mission. It will take about seven to eight hours.The fast return technique requires little adjustment to the hardware and software of the spacecraft, but mainly making the flight control more compact, Shao said."Conventionally we have prepared one entire day for the return of the taikonauts. Although such duration meets the standards, a day of flight in the tight cabin is uncomfortable for them, especially after they have spent six months in space. We want our taikonauts to return in a shorter time. That is why we decided to adopt the fast return technique," Shao noted.Bo Linhou, deputy chief designer of China's space station, said in an interview that two experimental modules are expected to be launched in the second half of this year. Current verification and assembly works of the modules are progressing smoothly.Both the experimental modules have a length of over 17 meters and a diameter of over 4 meters.The Wentian module is positioned to carry out space science experiments inside and outside the cabin. It has an airlock through which taikonauts can exit, and a small robotic arm that can be used alone or combined with the large mechanical arm in the space station.It can also serve as a backup to the core cabin, Bo said. If malfunction occurs in the core cabin, the Wentian module can replace it immediately, improving the reliability of the entire station's operation.The other experimental module, the Mengtian, has a cargo airlock. As payloads are brought to the station by a cargo spacecraft, they can be lifted outside by the robotic arm through the airlock cabin to carry out experiments.
