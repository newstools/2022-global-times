(Photo: Xinhua)Hungary's government cannot responsibly support the European Commission's new package of sanctions against Russia in its current form as it would "destroy" the country's security of energy supply, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto said on Wednesday.The EU will phase out Russian crude oil imports within six months and refined products by the end of 2022, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday, announcing the sixth package of sanctions against Russia.The new restrictions would involve a ban on crude oil shipments from Russia to Europe with a rather short notice, which in Hungary's case would apply from the end of 2023, Szijjarto said in a video message posted on his Facebook page.Hungary's energy supply is currently secure and stable, but this package of sanctions would "completely destroy" it, making it impossible for the country to procure the amount of oil needed to keep the economy running, he said.He recalled that Hungary was a landlocked country without access to the sea and to large tankers transporting crude oil from places other than Russia.Xinhua
