The civil litigations involved disputes over upbringing, visitation and right to life, health and body while criminal charges included theft, intentional assault, rape and child molestation.The family education instructions are targeted at four kinds of problems hidden in these cases. Some guardians hardly care about their children, paying no attention to their life and friends, as well as physical and mental state of teenagers, which left children with a criminal behavior instead of good moral values or habits.Others have no idea on how to properly educate their children. They either educate the children with outdated ideas and brutal methods or spoil them and turn a blind eye on their misbehavior.A broken marriage badly hurt the minors' sense of belonging and safety where selfish and irresponsible parents shirk the responsibility of educating a family. The neglect of some guardians on children's usage of internet, including the time they spend and the content they see, indirectly leads to the children's addiction and involvement in cybercrimes.These admonitions and instructions came amid the implementation of the Family Education Promotion Law on January 1, 2022, the first law in China to instruct parents to be responsible guardians.The court said it will further make regulations on the implementation of family education instruction and standards to assess improvement, paying attention to left-behind children, children in poor families and those whose parents are in jails, to provide precise protection.
