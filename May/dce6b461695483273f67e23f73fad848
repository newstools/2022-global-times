The country has 284 species of wild mammals and 861 species of birds, according to figures from the Convention on Biological Diversity."Ethiopia has been working on conservation activity. Among others, the most important and significant one is the conservation of crops and horticulture," Mario said.Ethiopia, Africa's second populous nation, has been the pioneer for the establishment of plant genetic resource centers for biodiversity conservation."We have a long experience and well-conserved crop and horticultural species," Mario said, adding that Ethiopia has taken conservation measures related to a gene bank."We have some unique and very shiny and attractive [initiatives] that can be a lesson for others... Ethiopia is among the pioneers in Africa to establish community seed banks," he said.Noting Ethiopia's rich livestock population, which is the largest in Africa, Mario said efforts are underway to protect the country's rich livestock resources.Xinhua
