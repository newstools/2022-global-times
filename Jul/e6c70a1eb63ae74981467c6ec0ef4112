And it has been proven over the last few decades that Western society is much quicker to use force - and it's a failure."Clissold noted that the Chinese people know more about Westerners than Westerners know about the Chinese, calling it "a dangerous knowledge imbalance."For one thing, not understanding the Chinese well gives the Chinese a competitive advantage, he said."And for another, it's bad for China as well, because if Westerners don't really understand it, and try to look at China through a purely Western lens, you can misjudge it," he said. "So that knowledge imbalance is quite dangerous for both sides."Western media's unbalanced reporting of China is partly to blame for such an imbalance, he noted."The press in the West plays a role which emphasizes a certain aspect of Chinese society in Chinese life, and diminishes the others. I think the press does an extremely bad job in Western society about trying to explain," said Clissold.He said there are things in the Chinese society that the Westerners will always find difficult, as a result of their different historical experiences."But I think that the basic needs and desires of Chinese people are very, very similar to Western people: You want a peaceful environment where you can develop your own life," he said. "I mean everybody should be able to recognize that."He praised what China has achieved over the past three to four decades as a "pretty amazing achievement." "I don't think that is properly recognized in the Western press."
