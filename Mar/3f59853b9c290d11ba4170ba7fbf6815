The mandate provides for the negotiation of binding global targets with monitoring mechanisms, the development of national plans and financing for poorer countries. Negotiators also have the scope to consider all aspects of pollution - not just plastic in the ocean but tiny particles in the air, soil and food chain - a key demand of many countries."We are 100 percent happy with the outcome," said Ana Teresa Lecaros, director of environment in the foreign ministry of Peru, a country that co-signed one of the draft resolutions. Inger Andersen, head of the UN Environment Programme, said a plastics treaty would be "one for the history books" and the most important pact for the planet since the Paris climate agreement. The rate of plastic production has grown faster than any other material and is expected to double within two decades, the UN says.But less than 10 percent is recycled, with most winding up in landfill or oceans.By some estimates, a garbage truck's worth of plastic is dumped into the sea every minute. "Plastic pollution has grown into an epidemic of its own," said Norway's climate and environment minister, Espen Barth Eide, who chairs UNEA.He said he was "quite optimistic" about bringing down the gavel on a strong resolution in Nairobi.Environment groups are also buoyed by the outcome of the talks, but like officials and diplomats, caution that the strength of any treaty will only be determined by rigorous negotiations to come. The first round of discussions is set for May, according to sources involved in the process.
