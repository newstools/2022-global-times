The Federal Indian boarding school system at times made older Indian children punish younger Indian children," the report said.Children in the boarding school system were not only abused, but taught skills that ill-prepared them for life after graduation.The system "focused on manual labor and vocational skills that left American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian graduates with employment options often irrelevant to the industrial US economy, further disrupting Tribal economies," the report said.AFP
