Some 1000 normal accounts that also violated the rules of Weibo were given punishment in accordance with their severeness, according to Weibo.Previously, observers revealed that vulgar remarks concerning Ukraine made by a very small portion of netizens on China's social media -- which have been overwhelmingly criticized in China -- are wrongly amplified online, and the real instigators of hyping "confrontation between Chinese netizens and Ukraine people" were from Taiwan and Xinjiang separatist forces.For a time, the outside world including Ukrainians wrongly interpreted the vulgar content that come from some individual irrational netizens and hype generated by separatist forces as a voice representing a majority of Chinese citizens. Global Times
