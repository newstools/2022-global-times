Along with Chad, those are the countries most affected by hunger.The region has also seen worsening floods and droughts due to the effects of climate change, making it harder to farm. Cereal production in 2021-22 was down 39 percent year-on-year in Niger and 15 percent in Mali, according to West Africa's Food Crisis Prevention Network.On top of that, global food prices have surged and trade has been disrupted due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Border closures due to COVID-19 have also had a negative impact, the Food Crisis Prevention Network said."What is new and worsening is mainly all the displaced people and abandoned land because of conflict, but also we are witnessing new drivers," said Assalama Dawalack Sidi, Oxfam's regional director for West and Central Africa.Six West African countries import 30-50 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.The Ukraine crisis also risks redirecting much-needed funding from the region, Sidi warned.Reuters
