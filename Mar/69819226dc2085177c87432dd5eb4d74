Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: fmprc.gov.cnThe US has been spreading disinformation and using the Ukraine crisis to smear China. Its rumor mongering in order to shift its own responsibilities is hypocritical and despicable, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday amid report that an anonymous US defense official criticized China for not condemning or imposing sanctions on Russia, and being reluctant to take part in a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine issue.The ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Friday's routine press briefing such smears cannot cover up the US' responsibility for the situation but instead exposes its real intention of taking advantage of the crisis.The spokesperson raised three questions for the US: Despite claiming the promotion of NATO's eastward expansion is to maintain peace, has the US done it? Despite claiming to prevent war in Europe, has the US done it? Despite claiming to be committed to the peaceful resolve of the crisis, but in addition to providing military assistance and increasing deterrence, what has the US done that is conducive to peace?China decides its position and policy according to the merits of the matter itself. We encourage all diplomatic efforts conducive to political settlement of the Ukraine issue, support Russia and Ukraine to address both sides' legitimate concerns in a way that is conducive to long-term peace and stability in Europe via dialogue and negotiation, Wang said, noting China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard. Amid the situation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southestern Ukraine, Wang said at the press briefing that China is highly concerned about the security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine and urged relevant parties to show restraint. China will continue to monitor the situation closely and call on relevant parties to remain calm and restrained, prevent further escalation of the situation, and ensure the safety of the nuclear facilities, Wang said.Multiple media have reported fire at the nuclear power plant, which is the largest of its kind in Europe and generates one quarter of the power supply in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister warned the disaster would be 10 times larger than that of Chernobyl. The International Atomic Energy Agency said later on Friday that they were informed by the Ukraine authority that the fire had not affected "essential" equipment and plant personnel were taking mitigatory actions. There was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant.Global Times
