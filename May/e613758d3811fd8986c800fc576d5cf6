European leaders arrive in Strasbourg, France on April 6, 2022 for a debate on more sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. European Council President Charles Michel (second left) said sanctions on Russian oil and gas will be needed "sooner or later."

Maritime cargos account for the remaining two thirds.The compromise was tabled by France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, and by the European Council, which represents the governments of the EU nations. Oil pumped in via the Druzhba pipeline would be excluded "for the time being," said one EU official.The aim is to break a stalemate that has, since early May, prevented the EU from imposing a sixth round of sanctions on Moscow over its military operations in Ukraine.The proposal envisages ending the purchases of Russian crude within six months and Russian petroleum products by the end of 2022.It would also impose additional sanctions on Russian banks and expand the list of Russian individuals blacklisted by the bloc.Yet EU ambassadors did not find agreement on the compromise, with one EU official saying a "difficult and complex discussion" failed to bridge disaccord.Another EU official said the mooted compromise raised questions of fairness on the sanctions burden shouldered by member states.An EU diplomat said it was hoped an agreement could still be reached in time for Monday's summit, though that was far from certain.The question of how they answer Russia is always "emotional" for certain member states and will be "one of the most sensitive issues" at the summit, the diplomat added.AFP
