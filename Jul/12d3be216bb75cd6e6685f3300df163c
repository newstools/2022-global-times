According to a report by the National Business Daily, China's 10 major consumption centers, including Shang-hai, Beijing and Guangzhou, have collectively issued nearly 7-billion-yuan worth of consumption coupons since April. Although the consumption recovery is still facing constraints such as a slowdown in the growth of individual incomes and limited spending opportunities, China's consumption scale is expanding, and is expected to maintain a sustained recovery, Fu said. Global Times
