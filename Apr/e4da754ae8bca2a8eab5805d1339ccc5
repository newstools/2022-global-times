(Photo: Xinhua)Ahead of the five-day Labor Day holiday in May, transportation authorities in Central China’s Henan Province announced an extension of the anti-epidemic policy, under which the health code of travelers who come to Henan, which is home to over 100 million people, will immediately turn yellow – an indication of people’s health status that shows they may have been to unsafe places and could be asked to stay home for seven days.The policy from Henan is one of a series of measures issued by local authorities to encourage citizens to avoid travel and stay in the cities where they work during the holiday, as a travel rush could elevate the risk of virus transmission amid outbreaks seen in several Chinese cities recently.People need to show their 48-hour nucleic acid negative results when arriving in Henan and they are also required to do a nucleic acid test twice within three days, in addition to their health code turning yellow.According to the Zhengzhou Daily, it is expected that travel and family visits will see a significant drop during the Labor Day holiday. The traffic at Henan’s highway exits is expected to decline by about 50 percent year-on-year to 4.2 million vehicles during the holiday.On Tuesday, the Shenzhen government also issued a notice on epidemic prevention for the Labor Day, requiring people arriving in the city to show their 48-hour nucleic acid negative results. The notice encouraged local residents to stay in the city, and travel agencies have had a temporary suspension put on group travel in medium- and high-risk provinces, border port cities and outbound destinations.Beijing also issued a similar notice, encouraging local residents not to leave the city unless necessary during the upcoming holiday. Travelers are also required to show their 48-hour nucleic acid negative results and green health code upon arrival.Global Times
