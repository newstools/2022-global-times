Photo: VCGBakeries in several cities, including Chongqing, Ningbo, Shantou, were investigated for making Beijing 2022 mascot Bing Dwen Dwen shaped cakes, which constitutes a violation of licensing rights of the Olympic symbols.The market watchdog in Nantong, East China's Jiangsu Province received tip off that a local bakery was selling Bing Dwen Dwen shaped cakes for 200 yuan ($31). The shop is now under investigation for using the Olympics symbol without authorization. Similarly, a dessert shop in Ningbo, Jiangsu Province was also punished for the same reason. The shop was ordered to suspend the sales of the cakes and placed under investigation.Such cases were also reported in Southwest China's Chongqing and Shantou, South China's Guangdong Province.The Regulations on the Protection of Olympic Symbols states that no one may use the Olympic symbols for commercial purposes without the permission of the right owners of the Olympic symbols.Besides cakes, there are also other products of the mascot on sale online. To evade law enforcement, some sellers deliberately changed the name or left a space between Bing and Dwen Dwen. The law enforcement department said that they are also subject to punishment as their behavior violates China's E-Commerce law. Local police in Beijing's Dongcheng district penalized three individuals last week for illicit sales of the mascots.
