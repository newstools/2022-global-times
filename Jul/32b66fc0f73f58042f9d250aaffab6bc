Huawei has strongly denied US government allegations that it could spy on US customers and poses a national security threat.Xiang cautioned that even if the investigation carries on, the impact on the firm could be limited as the firm has had to deal with multiple rounds of sanctions. "Smearing Chinese firms, including Huawei and creating barriers for their development, is the true intention behind the investigation," Xiang said.Global Times
