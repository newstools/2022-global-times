Chinese artist Wu Weishan has received a certificate of appreciation from The Weltmuseum Wien (the former Museum of Ethnology) in Vienna for his sculpture work The Painter, Qi Baishi at an official ceremony held on Thursday at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing.Wu donated the sculpture, which was inspired by renowned Chinese painter Qi Baishi, to the museum in 2021 as part of cultural exchanges between China and Austria marking the 50th anniversary of the bilateral relations between the two countries. According to the artist, the artwork created in 2012 depicts the painter Qi Baishi standing in front of his house and "welcoming friends from all over the world." "The stone under his foot looks like a Chinese ink stone. It was inspired by his ink paintings," added Wu.
