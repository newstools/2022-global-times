The Macao Museum of Art, for example, offered painting workshops to children aged between 5 and 10, where teachers guided the children through exhibitions of the museum and taught them to paint.George Leung, one of the students, said the special course was very attractive because it not only helped him better understand the exhibits, but also taught him to integrate the painting skills into his own works.The office said it encourages museums to keep innovating and inject vigor into the tourism market."The different museums of Macao provide multiple choices for tourists and help increase their understanding about Macao's history and culture, becoming an important source of unique memories," said Li.
