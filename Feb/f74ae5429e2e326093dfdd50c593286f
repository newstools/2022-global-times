Since then, it has made sporadic appearances in official reports, including a CCTV report in late 2020 and soon after a social media release by Shenyang Aircraft Company under the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the maker of the aircraft.None of the official reports explained the details of the differences between the upgraded variant and the original version other than the color of the radar dome, but analysts said the change of the radar dome suggests upgrades to the aircraft’s radar and avionics systems.It has been widely speculated that the improved J-11B uses advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to replace the original version’s pulse-Doppler radar, eastday.com said, noting that this will allow the aircraft to detect targets at longer ranges and wider angles, enjoy better situational awareness and stronger anti-jamming capability, and become capable of launching the advanced PL-15 long-range air-to-air missile.Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times that it is unknown whether the upgraded J-11B uses an AESA radar, because the aircraft still has a pitot tube on the front of its radar dome, which could lead to compatibility issues. But it is almost certain that a better radar is being used.With the improvement, the aircraft will remain in active service with high competitiveness for a long time, analysts said.The PLA Air Force has a large number of J-11Bs in its arsenal, and if all of them can be upgraded, it will significantly enhance the PLA Air Force’s capability, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times in a previous interview.
