Zhao Lijian Photo: VCGChinese Foreign Ministry on Friday slammed the US' recent "missile proliferation" sanctions on three Chinese military enterprises, saying it is a typical "bullying behavior" aimed to contain Chinese enterprises out of political motives, and reflects US double standards.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian urged the US to revoke the sanctions and stop suppressing and smearing China and Chinese enterprises, noting that China will reserve the right to take further action.  The remarks came as Federal Register, the daily journal of the US government, announced Friday that the US government determined that the three Chinese enterprises and their sub-units and successors had engaged in missile technology proliferation activities that require the imposition of the sanctions pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.The three enterprises are China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation First Academy, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Fourth Academy, and Poly Technologies Incorporated.Sanctions, including denial of all US government contracts with them and a ban on the importation into the US of their products, are being imposed for two years, according to the announcement.Zhao noted that China always opposes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and carriers of these weapons, and has strict regulations on the export of missile technologies. China's cooperation with some countries is in accordance with international laws and does not engage in any missile proliferation, Zhao said. However, the US always holds double standards on the issue of nonproliferation, as it not only supports allies to develop missile technologies, but also sells Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of 2,500 kilometers and capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Australia, Zhao said.The US should reflect on itself rather than make irresponsible remarks on other countries' normal military trade, Zhao said.The US government's actions obstruct normal bilateral communications, which indicates its psychological imbalance as the US government has politicized all issues related to China or Chinese companies, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday. US enterprises and the US government have a close relationship. However, the US government doesn't care whether the actions would damage enterprises doing business in China, Li said, noting that the US government has the hegemonic mentality. The US government has become a source of disorderly relations between China and the US, and also a stumbling block to the development of US enterprises in China, Li said, noting that it's still important for the world, including China, to strengthen communication with US enterprises to let the US government recover from a sick status and not to trigger further crises.
