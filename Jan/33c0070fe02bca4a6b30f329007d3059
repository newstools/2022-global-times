Photo: AFPCapitol Hill has begun to debate whether to ban US lawmakers from trading stocks, but despite some rare bipartisan unity on the question it is far from settled.Legislation introduced earlier in January by Democratic senators Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Mark Kelly of Arizona would require members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children to place their investments in a blind trust."Members of Congress should not be playing the stock market while we make federal policy and have extraordinary access to confidential information," Ossoff said. Republicans are also active on the issue, with Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introducing similar legislation to Ossoff and Kelly's and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying he could push for a ban on stock trading if the Republicans take control in the November 2022 midterm elections. "I think any member of Congress who actively trades stock is crazy," Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told AFP. "Let's say the price of that stock skyrockets, people are going to suspect you have insider information."Under the STOCK Act, which took effect in 2012, lawmakers are required to publicly report transactions within 45 days. But critics say the law is neither adequately policed nor sufficient for addressing the obvious problem of conflict of interest."The current problem is that the law is not enforced and it's not enough," said Kedric Payne, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, an NGO.
