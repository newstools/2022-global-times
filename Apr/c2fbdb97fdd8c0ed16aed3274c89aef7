Several women have accused veteran British hip-hop DJ Tim Westwood of predatory sexual behavior or groping, allegations which the radio and former TV presenter on Tuesday strenuously denied.Three women told the BBC and the Guardian newspaper that the former BBC Radio 1 DJ, 64, had abused his position in the music industry to exploit them sexually.Two of the women say they agreed to come to London to discuss their musical aspirations but were driven to Westwood's flat where he initiated unwanted and unexpected sex.One of the women was 19 at the time, when Westwood was 53.Another woman who was already in an R&B group said she was subjected to unwanted sex when she met the DJ when she was 17. Four other women accuse the DJ, who was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK, of touching them inappropriately while posing for photographs at events where Westwood was performing.A representative for Westwood said that the DJ "strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behavior."In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing."Westwood, who presented MTV UK's Pimp My Ride from 2005 to 2007, is the son of a former Anglican bishop from the east of England.He was wounded in a drive-by shooting in London in 1999, and is often cited as an inspiration for Sacha Baron Cohen's fictional Ali G character, a middle-class, suburban youth who acts in a way he thinks is typical of black people.
