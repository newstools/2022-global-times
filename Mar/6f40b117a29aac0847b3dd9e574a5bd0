Sabato said.What's more, several moderate Republican senators voted just a year ago to confirm Jackson to the US Circuit Court of Appeals.Several Republican lawmakers have criticized Biden for following through on his election-year pledge to select an African-American woman for the court."Black women are, what, 6 percent of the US population?" said Texas Senator Ted Cruz. "He's saying to 94 percent of Americans, 'I don't give a dxxn about you.'"Jackson has impeccable credentials, however, and another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, warned her colleagues to tread carefully."Given that Democrats, regrettably, have had some success in trying to paint Republicans as anti-black, it may make it more difficult to reject a black jurist," Collins said.AFP
