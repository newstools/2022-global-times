"The decision is tantamount to denying that climate change is real and threatens our very existence."Greenpeace Canada climate campaigner Patrick Bonin said fossil fuels need to be phased out as quickly as possible, and that the approval of Bay du Nord "only worsens the climate crisis and the global reliance on fossil fuels that are burning the planet."Even the New Democratic Party, a small leftist faction that recently agreed to prop up Trudeau's minority government, accused the Liberals of caving to "their corporate buddies from the oil and gas sector instead of listening to climate scientists.""Under the Liberals we have the worst record of any G7 country when it comes to emissions reductions, and we are the only country who has increased emissions every single year," the NDP said in a statement.The decision on the project had twice been delayed, after the Trudeau government in 2021 enhanced its Paris Agreement target to reduce carbon emissions by 40-45 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.AFP
