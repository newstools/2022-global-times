After the story went viral, netizens were quick to label it “love in the time of epidemic.”The woman has been quarantined under the same roof with her ex-husband for over 20 days in Shanghai as the city struggles with the most arduous fight against an epidemic that has infected over 180,000 people. In a video that was posted on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo, the woman was seen trying to “climb out from the window” with one foot stretched out and her hands clinging to the window edge. A man who appeared to be the ex-husband said in the video that they have worked things up over recent days and that he has decided to remarry the woman after the quarantine. However, the woman said she hasn’t made up her mind yet. Netizens who are anxious to learn about how the romantic story goes urged the man to behave well in such limited time, while others said that there must be reasons why the woman is reluctant, and suggested that others should stay out of their family business.
