Overall, nearly 90 percent of those exposed to inundations live in lower or middle income countries, according to the study.It also concluded the number of people living in poverty and under severe flood risk is "substantially higher than previously thought."Researchers found some $9.8 trillion of economic activity globally - around 12 percent of the global gross domestic product in 2020 - is located in areas exposed to severe flooding.But they said concentrating simply on a monetary value could cause a bias of attention toward higher income countries and economic hubs."By accounting for the poverty levels of exposed populations, we show that low-income countries are disproportionately exposed to flood risks, while being more vulnerable to disastrous long-term impacts," said the study by Jun Rentschler of the World Bank and colleagues.  AFP
