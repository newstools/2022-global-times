Unidentified gunmen believed to be militants Thursday shot dead a local level leader of the BJP in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said. The slain leader identified as Sajad Ahmad Khanday was attacked outside his residence at village Vessu. (Xinhua/Javed Dar)Police in India-controlled Kashmir arrested a youth for posting a video threatening to behead a former spokesperson of India's ruling party who had made derogatory remarks about Islam's religious leader Prophet Mohammad, officials said on Sunday.The video, circulated on YouTube, has been withdrawn by authorities as part of a wider attempt to curb religious unrest that has spread across the country.Muslims have taken to the streets to protest against anti-Islamic comments made by two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent week. Earlier in June, the BJP suspended its spokeswoman Nupur Sharma and expelled another leader, Naveen Kumar Jindal, for their controversial comments about the Prophet's private life that also angered several Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, causing a massive diplomatic challenge for the Modi government. Police cases have been filed against the two former BJP officials.Countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Iran which are key trade partners for India, lodged protests through diplomatic channels and used social media to demand an apology from the government.India's foreign ministry said last week the tweets and comments do not reflect the views of the government.Clashes over the remarks simmered across the country, as some in the minority Muslim community see them as the latest instance of pressure and humiliation under BJP rule on issues ranging from freedom of worship to the wearing of hijab head scarves.Reuters
