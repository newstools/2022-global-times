Also on Monday, a Y-8 reconnaissance plane and a J-11 fighter jet of the PLA entered Taiwan's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, Taiwan's defense authority announced in a press release.The island of Taiwan launched on Monday its annual Han Kuang military drills which aim to "test Taiwan's readiness in air defense, combat capacity preservation, and counterattack capabilities," local media reported.The five-day drills will simulate a scenario in which the PLA launches an assault on the island. Taiwan's warplanes will fly to the eastern part of the island, its warships will leave ports to evade attacks and its ground units will focus on defense and preparation for counterattacks, media reported.Taiwan's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen will oversee a large-scale maritime exercise on the waters of Yilan's Su'ao, in the east of the island, on Tuesday. Joint exercises will be held in key locations, including freshwater estuaries and the Port of Taipei, according to the reports.Regardless of the training exercises of the Han Kuang drills, there is no changing the fact that the PLA holds an overwhelming advantage against Taiwan's armed forces should they attempt to resist reunification by force, Chinese mainland analysts said.The Han Kuang drills are more of a show rather than anything of military significance, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Monday.Taiwan's armed forces are hyping an atmosphere of war and a potential cross-Straits conflict through the drills to build up anxiety among ordinary people in the island and make the mainland look dangerous, creating excuses to purchase more US weapons and equipment, Wei said.But the real creators of the tensions across the Taiwan Straits are the "Taiwan independence" secessionists and foreign interference forces like the US, observers said.
