In December's voyage, the group reportedly featured at least six vessels - the Liaoning, a Type 055, a Type 052D, two Type 054As and a Type 901. In another far sea exercise in April 2021, the carrier group also consisted of some six warships - the Liaoning, a Type 055, two Type 052Ds, a Type 054A and a Type 901. Back in 2016 when the Liaoning first had a far sea training in the West Pacific, it had three destroyers, three frigates and a supply ship as escorts.The latest movement by the Liaoning carrier task force is likely a part of regular PLA Navy exercises, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday, adding that far sea exercises have already become routine for the Liaoning, as the PLA Navy is making strides to become a deep-blue navy, Based on previous voyages, after sailing through the Miyako Strait, the Chinese vessels could go further east into the Pacific Ocean, or they could transit through the Bashi Channel south to the island of Taiwan and conduct exercises in the South China Sea, the expert predicted.The quality and quantity of warships featured in the carrier group - including a whopping five "Chinese Aegis" destroyers - are very impressive and reflect the rapid growth of the PLA Navy, the expert said.By featuring a number of different types of main battle vessels, the current Liaoning carrier group is a complete group that has significantly higher combat capability than before, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.It is possible that the carrier group is also accompanied by underwater forces, Song said.All far sea exercises are part of preparations for actual combat, and it is certain that aircraft carriers will take part in preparations for a potential military conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Song said.The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force dispatched the Izumo, a de facto aircraft carrier, as well as P-1 maritime patrol aircraft and P-3C anti-submarine aircraft to gather intelligence and monitor the activities of the Chinese vessels, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in the press release.It is almost certain that Japanese and US warships and warplanes will conduct close-in reconnaissance attempts and make some provocative moves on the Chinese flotilla, so the Chinese vessels and vessel-based aircraft must have been well prepared to confidently deal with them, analysts said.
