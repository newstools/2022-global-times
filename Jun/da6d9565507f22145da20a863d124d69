A maglev train Xingguo using the first permanent magnet maglev technology rolls off the production line in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province on December 14, 2021. The demonstration train features energy-saving functions, non-contact traction and strong climbing ability. The maximum speed is 120 kilometers per hour.

Different from superconducting maglev train and normal conductive maglev train, the new technology can achieve elevation status without being powered, according to the report.China is a leader in the development of maglev trains. In July 2021, the world's fastest maglev transportation system with a speed of 600 kilometers per hour rolled off assembly line in Qingdao, East China's Shandong Province.
