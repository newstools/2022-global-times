Mohamed Ibrahim Moalimuu's "injuries are not serious and we wish him quick recovery."Multiple sources said the attacker, who was killed in the incident, attempted to get onto the spokesman's car before detonating explosives, partially destroying the vehicle."A suicide bomber jumped onto a vehicle transporting the spokesman of the government of Mohamed Ibrahim," said a policeman at the scene of the attack, Mohamed Farah."He was lucky to have survived with light injuries," Farah said, adding that two other people were injured.Witnesses confirmed that the attacker had pressed himself against the car before a loud explosion was heard.One witness, Abdirahman Moalin Ali, said he had seen "human body parts strewn across the area."Al-Shabaab swiftly claimed the attack in a statement. Moalimuu has been a spokesman and adviser to the prime minister for more than a year, having previously been a journalist with the BBC, and is a former secretary general of the National Union of Somali Journalists. He has survived several attacks on residences.
