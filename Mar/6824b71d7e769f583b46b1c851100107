But if the mission features 200 aircraft, one officer just cannot do it," Feng said on CCTV.Another aspect is that the growing fleet of strategic transport aircraft is essentially changing the ways the Chinese military can maneuver, so it is not enough for a Y-20 pilot to just fly the aircraft and land it safely, Feng said.China has been testing two new types of domestically developed engines for the Y-20, the aircraft's chief designer Tang Changhong revealed at the Airshow China 2021. With the indigenous engines, China is expected to produce the Y-20 in larger numbers, experts told the Global Times.Last year, Feng and his colleagues participated in the International Army Games 2021 in Russia with the Y-20, and the cross-border flight inspired Feng to propose the installation of logistics support equipment and devices for the Y-20 across the country's civil airports, CCTV reported.During the mission, Feng's aircraft stopped by at a Chinese civil airport, and Feng found that the logistics support provided by the airport can be optimized, as the logistics support standard provided by the civil airport is different from the needs of the Y-20, according to Feng.To resolve this issue, the civil airport said it would be great if some related equipment and devices can be installed at the airport in advance, Feng said.Since 2020, the Y-20 has carried out a number of military operations other than war, highlighted by the fight against the COVID-19 domestically then across the border, transporting medical personnel and vital anti-epidemic equipment and vaccines. It would be very important if civil airports across the country can provide more logistics support to the Y-20 in these missions in the future, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday.Over the past year, Feng and his Y-20 participated in a number of major drills and military operations other than war, flying through plateaus, far sea and deserts, CCTV reported.The missions tested and enhanced the Y-20's combat capabilities, and demonstrated its adaptability to complex weather changes and operating environments that posed challenges to the aircraft, Feng said. "It is a reliable aircraft and a good comrade of ours."
