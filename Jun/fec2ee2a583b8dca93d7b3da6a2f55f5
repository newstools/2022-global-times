Former fisherman Simon Pronk, 72, said the oily fish is the "most important thing" for Scheveningen. Every year from around mid-June, the Dutch consume millions of herring, and people can be seen all round the country swallowing the slippery snack.The 2022's festival, known as "Vlaggetjesdag" (day of the little flags), returned to its former glory, with ships lining the harbor and dozens of stalls selling herring and fishing-related trinkets on Saturday.
