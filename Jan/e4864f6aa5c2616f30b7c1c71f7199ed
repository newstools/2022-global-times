But the ministry said it has issued the emergency decree now because the crude still in the water keeps spreading and now reaches 40 kilometers from the spot of the original spill. In declaring the emergency Saturday, the environment ministry said "the spill amounts to a sudden event of significant impact on the coastal marine ecosystem, which has major biological diversity."It said that over the short term Repsol is responsible for emergency cleanup operations.Its refinery is in the town of Ventanilla near Lima.Repsol has said the spill occurred because of freak waves caused by the eruption in the Pacific.
