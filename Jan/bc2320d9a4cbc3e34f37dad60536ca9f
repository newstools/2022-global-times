The rest say it should be "Invasion Day." Australia's 700,000 or so Indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator. Living often in remote communities, they also have been at greater risk from COVID-19. Most of the 200 or so Aboriginal communities spread across Western Australia are closed to tourists and travelers.Australia on Wednesday recorded at least 74 deaths from the virus, one of its highest number of deaths in a day, as the highly-infectious Omicron variant tore through the country.
