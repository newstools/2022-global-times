"The major alternative trade routes to European cities are Małaszewicze in eastern Poland and Russia's Kaliningrad," Tan said. The company is also seeking new sea ports with train service networks in Russia or other European countries as part of the contingency plans for European clients.The disruption has also affected sea transportation, with international shipping companies changing routes amid rising safety concerns from the conflict."Earlier this week, we communicated a full stop to bookings destined to or originating from Ukraine... cargo currently en route to Ukraine is being discharged in Port Said and Korfez," Maersk said in its latest statement on Saturday. Gary Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics, confirmed to the Global Times on Sunday that some international shipping companies are adjusting their shipping schedules due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the actual impact is still not clear.Lau's company mainly operates on European trading routes, and he admitted that there has been some impact on European clients, whether they are shipping cargo by sea or by air."They are more prudent about taking orders these days," Lau said, noting that the longer the tension lasts, the greater the impact on the entire European logistics chain."Ships cannot get into ports, and all the flight and port services have already been halted," Qu Bo, chairman of a Chinese chamber of commerce in Odessa in Southern Ukraine, told the Global Times on Sunday.The impact on logistics includes shipments of goods such as shoes and clothing from China to Ukraine, Qu said.Despite the disruption, industry analysts noted that the overall impact on China-Europe freight trains from the regional conflict is manageable, mainly because the proportion of these trains going through Ukraine is relatively low, experts said."The Ukrainian route is not the main channel of the China-Europe freight train, accounting for about 3-5 percent of the entire China-Europe freight train capacity," a senior industry insider told the Global Times on Sunday.The total container throughput of Ukrainian ports in 2020 reached 1.03 million 20-foot equivalent units, which was only 0.13 percent of global port container throughput, data from the Shanghai International Shipping Research Center (SISI) showed."Judging from the density of containership routes in Ukrainian waters, it is much lower than in the Mediterranean region," Zheng Jingwen, a research fellow at the SISI, told the Global Times on Sunday.Therefore, disruptions caused by the Russian-Ukrainian conflict have far less impact on container transportation than events such as the previous Suez Canal congestion, experts said.However, given that the turnover of the container market has encountered bottlenecks and container freight rates are already high and volatile, the market response to emergencies can be very sensitive toward the situation in Europe, Zheng noted.
