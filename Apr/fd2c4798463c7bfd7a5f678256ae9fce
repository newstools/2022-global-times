"Going forward, we must use technology to create a global database, repository of traditional medicine practices," to help future generations."They should also make international standards so that people's trust in these traditional medicines goes up."The hub will focus on four strategic areas: evidence and learning; data and analytics; sustainability and equity; and innovation and technology.It is hoped that a solid evidence base will help countries regulate quality and safety.Of the WHO's 194 member states, 170 acknowledged their use of traditional and complementary medicine since 2018, but only 124 reported having laws or regulations for the use of herbal medicines - while only half had a national policy on such methods and medicines.AFP
