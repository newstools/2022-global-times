Social gatherings indoors were banned at the time.The prime minister was believed to have been presented with a cake while his wife led staff in a chorus of happy birthday, it said.Johnson's office disputed that it was a party, telling ITV: "A group of staff working in No. 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday."ITV said there was another gathering in Downing Street the evening before his birthday. Johnson's office said that was "totally untrue."Johnson has given explanations about the previous allegations of parties: First he said no rules had been broken but then he apologized to the British people for the apparent hypocrisy of such gatherings.Police officers who guard Downing Street have been interviewed by Gray, the Telegraph newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source."Johnson has completely lost his authority," Nick Timothy, who served as Downing Street chief of staff to Johnson's Conservative predecessor Theresa May, wrote in the Telegraph."The collapse in Johnson's authority is causing widespread political dysfunction and further danger for the Conservative," Timothy said. "Johnson is no longer popular, he is no longer powerful."Johnson has denied an allegation that he was told a "bring your own booze" lockdown gathering on May 20, 2020.To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 359 Conservative MPs in parliament must submit letters of no confidence.Leading rivals within the Conservative Party include Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, 41, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, 46.Johnson on Monday ordered an inquiry into allegations by a lawmaker who said she was fired from a ministerial job in the government partly because her Muslim faith was making colleagues uncomfortable.AFP
