The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) Photo: VCG The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Friday said it is disappointed that the European Union (EU) has challenged China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over patent protection and will handle the matter in accordance with WTO rules to resolutely safeguard China’s legitimate rights and interests.The statement comes after the EU launched a legal challenge against China at the WTO on Friday over patent protection.The head of MOFCOM’s Department of Treaty and Law said on Friday that the Chinese side had been informed of the EU consultation request that involves China’s practices in some patent lawsuits.“It has been obvious to all that China has continuously improved its intellectual property protection legislation and law enforcement in strict accordance with WTO rules and accession commitments. The channels of communication between China and the EU on intellectual property issues are open,” the MOFCOM official said.“It is a usual channel for members to resolve economic and trade disputes within the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. China has always upheld the multilateral trading system and will handle follow-up matters in accordance with WTO rules to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the official added.
