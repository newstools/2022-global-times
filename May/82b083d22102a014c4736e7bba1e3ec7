The biggest ideological difference is that the Taliban pursued an Afghanistan free of foreign forces, whereas IS wants an Islamic caliphate stretching from Turkey to Pakistan and beyond.Taliban officials insist their forces have defeated IS, but analysts say the jihadist group remains a key security challenge.AFP
