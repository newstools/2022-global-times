He hopes he can come back to Taiwan to visit his uncles and welcomes them to visit him on the Chinese mainland."Beijing is such a big stage and I have missed out on many of the big events that have taken place in the past. It is an honorable and meaningful opportunity to participate as a volunteer in such an international event," Yao said. In order to be selected, Yan had passed the College English Test before he signed up as a volunteer, attended the Red Cross rescue training organized by the university and obtained a corresponding certificate."My parents think the Beijing 2022 is a very important event and it's an honor for me to be a part of it and they are very proud of me." Yao will be a volunteer in the Yanqing competition zone in the suburban area of Beijing.There are around 200,000 volunteers for urban work for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 16 service stations around the Olympic venues, 149 urban volunteer service stations, nine venues for ice and snow sports and 507 key communities, said the Beijing Municipality on Wednesday during a press conference.According to Yao, the mainland has done a good job in epidemic prevention and control, and Beijing has many policies to support students from Taiwan to start businesses and find jobs, which gives opportunities and hope.
