In fact, we embrace people from other countries." He promised to address "with the sensitivity that it requires" concerns that foreigners are taking jobs meant for South Africans.Ramaphosa says his greatest concern is the state of the South African economy and the staggering levels of unemployment among his country's 59 million people."It's very difficult to have to countenance 11 million people out of work, who are not economically engaged in any activity - that is enough to keep me awake at night," he said.According to South Africa's statistics agency, some 3.95 million foreigners live in the country, including political refugees and qualified expatriate workers as well as economic migrants.AFP
