The skyline at night of the Macao Special Administrative Region, China Photo: IC The Macao Special Administrative Region will ease travel requirements for visitors from the Chinese mainland starting on Thursday, extending the valid period of negative COVID-19 test results from 72 hours to 7 days for visitors entering through Zhuhai port of entry in South China's Guangdong Province.In response to the epidemic situation in the neighboring areas, and after reaching an agreement on the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism between Zhuhai and Macao, the Macao authorities announced on Wednesday that individuals entering Macao from Guangdong Province via the Zhuhai-Macao checkpoints or by sea must hold a proof of negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test within 7 days after the date of sampling.For those who are travelling from Macao to Guangdong Province, the validity period of the proof of negative testing result will stand at 7 days. Other cross-boundary epidemic prevention requirements remain unchanged.It is a very good sign that the movement of people between the mainland and Macao at the port has become more convenient, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs from Nankai University, told the Global Times on Wednesday."Zhuhai port is a very important crossing between the mainland and Macao. At its peak the daily traffic can reach hundreds of thousands of people," Li said. "The requirement for proper relaxation of passage at such a large port is very important for many people living across the city."Macao's economy relies heavily on the mainland in a variety of ways, including tourism and gaming. Further relaxation of restrictions on people entering and exiting is important for Macao, Li said.Li also noted that subsequent entry requirements are expected to be further based on changes of the epidemic situation.Previously, even when the epidemic rebounded in mainland provinces, travel between the mainland and Macao was not blocked.For the other special administrative region, Hong Kong, the resumption of quarantine-free entry and exit with the mainland will likely happen after new Chief Executive takes office, observers noted.
