Beijing will strictly implement the principle," the Beijing Daily reported.The response came after the new regulation released on Monday by the city. It required that starting from July 11, most people need to be vaccinated before entering some public venues, including in-person training institutions, libraries, museums, cinemas, art galleries, cultural centers, sports venues, gyms, performance and entertainment settings and internet cafes.
