If Pence is ultimately deposed, it could be weeks or months away.While the conservative Pence was never a favorite of Democrats, "on that day he was a hero for resisting all the pressure campaigns," Jamie Raskin, a committee member, told NBC's "Meet the Press.""In a time of absolutely scandalous betrayal of people's oaths of office and crimes being committed all over the place, somebody who does their job and sticks to the law will stand out as a hero."The pressure campaign, Schiff said, "put the vice president's life in danger."The committee, in hearings Tuesday and Thursday, will also explore "how a similar pressure campaign directed against state and local elections officials put their lives in danger."Trump, in a taped call, famously called Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and asked him to "find" enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in that key Southern state. Raffensperger, who refused to do so, is to be among the committee's witnesses this week.Raffensperger is among several election officials who have received anonymous death threats for refusing to alter vote outcomes in Trump's favor.Adam Kinzinger - one of two Republicans on the House committee, and one of 10 who voted in 2021 to impeach Trump - said Sunday he had received a menacing message only days ago.AFP
