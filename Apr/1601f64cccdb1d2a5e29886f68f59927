Soldiers guard a fuel station in Colombo on March 22, 2022. Sri Lanka ordered troops to petrol stations as sporadic protests erupted among the thousands of motorists queueing up daily for scarce fuel. The decision to position troops near petrol pumps and kerosene supply points came after three elderly people dropped dead during their wait in long queues, Reuters said.

We have to decide who gets treatment and who will not," the group said Sunday, after releasing a letter they had sent President Gotabaya Rajapaksa days earlier to warn him of the situation.Mounting public anger over the crisis has seen large protests calling for Rajapaksa's resignation.Thousands of people braved heavy rains to keep up a demonstration outside the leader's seafront office in the capital Colombo for a second day.Business leaders joined calls for the president to step down on Saturday and said the island's chronic fuel shortages had seen their operations hemorrhage cash.Rajapaksa's government is seeking an IMF bailout to help extricate the South Asian country from the crisis, which has seen skyrocketing food prices and the local currency collapse in value by a third in the past month. AFP
