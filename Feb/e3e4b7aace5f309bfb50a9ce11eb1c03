They may also consider upping their hours on their part-time jobs to meet the extra fuel costs."I just feel that we're going to struggle more and more ... our quality of life has gone down," Blankley told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Demand for solutionsAnxious to cushion the impact of rising energy prices, European governments have been taking action - from banning disconnections to cash handouts to help protect poorer households.Britain's government has announced it will provide all households with a 200-pound discount from October, to be repaid over five years, with the majority of households also getting an extra 150-pound rebate on council tax bills.Those measures have been declared "woefully inadequate" by National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, which says more targeted help is needed to protect the poorest.The opposition Labour party backed calls for a windfall tax on energy companies enjoying bumper returns - though energy bosses have argued such action would have little impact on prices and it shows no sign of being taken up by the government.Some are making more radical demands.Fuel Poverty Action has launched an "Energy for all" campaign arguing every household should get enough free heat to cover its basic needs and get rid of fuel poverty entirely.Climate and energy experts have said the crisis underlines the need to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy as its generation costs fall, as well as insulating homes to make them more energy efficient.As the poorest wait in hope for more help, Sam said he knew that as he settles in each night in his cold and drafty house, there are many others like him."There's going to be more hospital admissions with hypothermia - or worst-case scenario, death," he predicted.Reuters
