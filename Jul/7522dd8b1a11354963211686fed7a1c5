North Macedonia's Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski announced Saturday that Skopje had reached a compromise with Bulgaria in a long-running dispute, allowing them to start European Union membership talks.EU member Bulgaria had until recently blocked any progress for such talks because of a dispute between the countries over linguistic and historical issues.But in June, Bulgarian deputies approved lifting that veto in exchange for EU guarantees that North Macedonia meets certain demands on the issues in question."Finally, after 17 years, we are starting the process of accession negotiations with the European Union," Kovacevski told reporters after a parliamentary vote.Earlier, the parliament in Skopje had adopted a framework for negotiations aimed at protecting North Macedonia's language and identity, a decision welcomed in Brussels.Following the vote in North Macedonia's parliament, deputies held up both the national flag and that of the EU in the chamber.But opposition deputies had already walked out of the chamber."What the [government] has accepted is a betrayal of Macedonia and the Macedonian people," said a statement from the main opposition nationalist right-wing VMRO-DPMNE party."This is a complete Bulgarization and assimilation of Macedonia," it added.Bulgaria had been holding up progress on EU membership talks for both North Macedonia and Albania since 2020. Last month's parliamentary vote in Sofia to end those objections came with certain conditions.The decision says Skopje must include Bulgarians in its constitution "on an equal footing with other peoples"; and implement a treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation signed with Bulgaria in 2017. That treaty was designed to end discrimination and hate speech.
