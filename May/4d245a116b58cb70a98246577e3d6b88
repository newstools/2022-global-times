In Hubei, those who buy NEVs in the second half of this year are eligible for government subsidies of up to 8,000 yuan, the provincial government announced on Tuesday.Experts said more first and second-tier cities with limits on the number of license plates will increase their quotas.

We will definitely have cars that meet the requirements. Our commercial vehicles and most passenger cars will be eligible," a person with Great Wall Motor told the China Securities Journal.Car sales in May saw a gradual recovery from April, when sales plunged 35.5 percent year-on-year due to plant stoppages and logistics difficulties amid COVID-19 resurgences.Car sales in the first three weeks of May hit 780,000, up 34 percent from the same period in April, but still 16 percent lower than the same period in 2021, according to data from the CPCA on Wednesday.Experts said car sales would pick up gradually in the second quarter, and the full-year figure would be approximately the same as last year as COVID-19 flare-ups are brought under control and more support measure are implemented."Vehicle output is expected to return to normal in June and losses could be made up for in the second half of the year," Zhang said.
