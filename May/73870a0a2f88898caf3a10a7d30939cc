Chen told the Global Times on Tuesday that the bilateral fishing cooperation programs, which include rules on areas where fishing is legal, are beneficial to both local fishermen and the fishing industry.Seeing the huge benefits of such collaboration, some countries that have not reached fishery cooperation with China or achieved fishery reciprocity with China started to use the so-called "illegal" fishing activities to stir up trouble, Chen said. China is a responsible fishing country that has been cooperating internationally to clamp down on illegal fishing. For example, its fishery authorities have introduced punishments for overfishing and illegal fishing by the country's distant water fishing vessels, according to media reports.The US is worried about Chinese ships coming ashore, connecting normal fishing operations to building a military base, Chen said, adding "this is out of a Cold War mentality, demonizing normal economic activities, turning normal fishery cooperation into a security concern."Campbell led a US delegation to the Solomon Islands last month. Washington said it would have "significant concerns and respond accordingly" to any steps to establish a permanent Chinese military presence there, media said.Washington's plan to obstruct China's fishing in the Pacific came after it failed to prevent the Solomon Islands from signing the security agreement with China, seen as its Waterloo for its hegemony strategy in the region.Experts noted that Washington sees the South Pacific as an important "fulcrum" against China as it has sought to further push forward its Indo-Pacific strategy through the region.
