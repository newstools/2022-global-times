"We will try our best to stabilize the economy and preserve employment. The epidemic is stubborn, but as long as all walks of life in Hong Kong work together, maintain a strong momentum, and do not relax or slack off, we will surely win the battle against the epidemic."Chan also noted in his blog post on Sunday that no systemic risks were seen in the Hong Kong stock exchange despite volatility last week, adding that there was no outflow of funds, and the financial situation of securities companies was sufficient to deal with market risks.Chan has previously warned that the city's GDP may contract in the first quarter of 2022, with higher unemployment due to the outbreak of COVID-19, while expressing confidence in the future of Hong Kong's economy, bolstered by the steady growth of the national economy and its sound long-term fundamentals.The comments came amid a severe surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the HKSAR. Official data showed on Sunday that a total of 14,149 new confirmed cases and 246 new deaths were reported on Saturday. The latest wave of the epidemic in Hong Kong has infected more than 1.03 million people. Addressing a daily press conference on anti-epidemic measures on Saturday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that the HKSAR government has distributed hundreds of thousands of anti-epidemic supply kits to residents in areas with higher numbers of positive cases of COVID-19 since early March, while the Home Affairs Department of the HKSAR government has distributed 4 million rapid antigen test kits to the public.The HKSAR government has distributed medical supplies provided by the central government to the public through different channels, including several hundred thousand boxes of anti-epidemic traditional Chinese medicines, Lam added.
