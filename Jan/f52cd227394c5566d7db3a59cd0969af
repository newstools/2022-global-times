But "obviously there were no police" present on Sunday when she was shot outside her house, said De Anda, a member of the media rights group Yo si soy periodista (I am a journalist).Jorge Carrasco, director of the weekly news magazine Proceso, turned to the mechanism in 2013 after receiving death threats for his work. He was assigned a body guard and cameras were installed in his house."In my case it worked. But the mechanism was overwhelmed. There were so many cases," he said, alleging insufficient commitment from other state institutions and a lack of coordination with regional authorities. That was a factor in the murders in Tijuana, journalists said."Due to a change of governor [in Baja California], the mechanism stopped operating" and was supposed to be reinstated on Monday, said De Anda."In the meantime, two of us were killed," she said. More than 100 journalists have been murdered since 2000 in Mexico and only a fraction of the crimes have resulted in convictions.
