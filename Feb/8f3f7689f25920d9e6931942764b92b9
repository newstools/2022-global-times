While expressing shock and concern over this case, many have questioned 58.com for allowing false job advertisements to be posted and called for further government scrutiny on the content of the platform."My heart is trembling when I see it," a netizen said while urging 58.com to give an explanation over the case.58.com did not respond to a request from the Global Times for comment as of Thursday.The gang drew Li's blood since August 2021 for nearly half a year. Li told media that because he refused to participate in online fraud activities, he was resold many times. Meanwhile, every six weeks as many as three bottles of about 1500 ml of his blood were drawn in seven occasions.After several days of treatment at the Cambodia-China Friendship Preah Kossamak Hospital, in Phnom Penh, Li's health condition has improved and is still undergoing further treatment, according to media reports.The Chinese Embassy in Cambodia reminded Chinese citizens who want to work in that country to follow formal channels and not to believe in false advertisements for high-paying jobs.
