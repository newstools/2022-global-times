Zhao noted that Chinese enterprises have the ability to complete the construction mission but the LRT system may bring financial pressure to the operators of the system. Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang hailed the LRT project as a remarkable cooperation program between China and Egypt under the BRI while attending the opening ceremony held on Saturday at the Adly Mansour Station, the largest transfer station in the Middle-East.Since 2000, Chinese companies have completed more than 10,000 kilometers of railways in Africa, in addition to more than 100,000 kilometers of road, nearly 1,000 bridges, nearly 100 ports and a vast number of hospitals and schools, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."The LTR will directly benefit Egyptian people's livelihoods amid the current global fuel price surges, and it is an important milestone in the China-Africa cooperation process," He noted.
