It also gives birth to many more new risks, such as financial fraud, if those platforms don't know how to manage the capital properly," Fu said. Besides intensifying payment oversight, officials also stressed that they would raise supervision of platform companies. The meeting on Wednesday noted that China would protect the legitimate rights of financial consumers, strengthen platform companies' anti-monopoly and anti-competitive management, regulate algorithm discrimination and strengthen data management.Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times that China will continue to be vigilant on the management of large online entities, as their burgeoning scale could pose risks. "The platform economy's development pace has been too fast, and policymakers are worrying that it will get out of control, as signs have shown that those platforms' business styles can pose dangers to customers and to society, such as hindering many companies' survival space because of monopoly operations," he said. Global Times
