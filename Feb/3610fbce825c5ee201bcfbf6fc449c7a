People remain outside as men work at the Monaco building, which was once home to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and has been covered with pictures of victims of his Medellin cartel, in Medellin, Colombia, on Tuesday.

The government of conservative Ivan Duque has expressed its intention that he be extradited soon to the US. Colombia is officially at peace after signing a pact with the FARC guerilla group in 2016 to end more than half-a-century of armed conflict. AFP
