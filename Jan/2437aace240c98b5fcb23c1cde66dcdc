His presence will fully underscore the shared hope of the international community for the future, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday. Polish President Andrzej Duda will attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a top aide. On January 10, President Xi sent a message of sympathy to Duda after he tested positive for COVID-19. "We noticed that President Duda has recovered recently and returned to work. China warmly welcomes his participation in the opening ceremony of the Games, which also underscores a shared will of the international community," Zhao said, noting that China has confidence to work with all the parties in practicing the Olympic spirit and presenting simple, safe and fascinating Games. When asked on the number of world leaders who will participate in the Games, Zhao said many heads of state, government leaders and royal family members have registered to participate in the Games, which are all welcome. Some top leaders and officials from the international organizations have already confirmed their participation despite of the US-led West call for the so-called diplomatic boycott of the Games. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said he will attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics. Russian president Vladimir Putin, Pakistani President Arif Alvi and Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene also confirmed their attendance. Global Times
