Experts believe that as the trade ties go deeper and wider, this trend may continue this year.In addition to the signing of energy cooperation, Chinese and Russian companies also signed a number of memorandums of cooperation involving trade in food and other daily necessities as both sides seek to unleash the potential in the cross-border supply chain.Driven by widening potentials for cooperation, China and Russia are moving toward cooperation in the entire industrial chain, including transportation, experts said."Russia is facing the narrowing of westbound cooperation, and China and Russia will need a huge space for improvement in the field of transportation and logistics, including the further improvement in the capacity of the China-Europe freight trains," Li said.
