China's major targets in 2022

Government measures are effective and policies are flexible. Even if there are external shocks, we can maintain independent macroeconomic policies," Yu Yongding, former president of the China Society of World Economics and director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.Another closely-watched data is China's deficit-to-GDP ratio, which was set at around  2.8 percent for 2022, according to the Government Work Report.Analysts said that in general, China's deficit-to-GDP ratio still has room to grow and is not high compared with Western economies, predicting the central government will take more fiscal moves, including launching more tax and fee cuts for small and medium enterprises, to tackle downward pressure.
