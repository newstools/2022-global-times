The cave contains more than 60,000 cultural relics ranging from the 4th to 11th centuries AD, including scriptures, documents and silk paintings. However, due to historical reasons, these precious cultural relics have been scattered all over the world, and most people have no chance to see their true colors. The Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes are a 1,600-year-old UNESCO world heritage site. Located at a cultural and religious crossroads on the ancient Silk Road, they are also known as the Thousand Buddha Grottoes.With the rapid development of the digital economy, more technology companies and cultural institutions have joined hands to introduce cutting-edge digital technologies to explore new forms of digital cultural protection.In May, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, China's cabinet, jointly released a guideline underpinning digitalization of the cultural industry.The country will speed up the digital layout of the industry, help cultivate a group of cultural enterprises in the fields of cultural data collection, processing and trading, and support eligible digital cultural enterprises in IPOs on the science and technology innovation board, also known as the STAR Market, the guideline read.Global Times
