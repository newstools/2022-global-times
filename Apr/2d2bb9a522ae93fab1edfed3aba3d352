The time for that work varies depending on the species."For instance, it takes 10 years to breed a new species of clover, and oats may take seven to eight years," said Yang.Clover is one of most important feed materials for livestock which remains a shortcoming for the country's agricultural sector."China has to import 1.3 million to 1.5 million tons of clover each year. Clover seeds from space may accelerate Chinese clover species breeding and ensure the development of this 'chip' in agriculture," said Wang Tao, professor at China Agricultural University. China's space seed breeding level also reflects the nation's advancing aerospace technology, Li noted. "There are only a few countries in the world with mature aerospace technology, and China's level of space seed breeding technology is at the world-class level," Li said.Global Times
