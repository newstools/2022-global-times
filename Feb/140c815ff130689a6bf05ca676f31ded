Photo: Chinese Mission to the EU Regional security should not be guaranteed by strengthening or expanding a military bloc, the spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU said in response to a question concerning the remarks by NATO Secretary General on China-Russia joint statement.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that in the joint statement issued by China and Russia, the two countries called on NATO to stop admitting new members, which is an attempt to deny sovereign nations the right to make their own choices.The spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU replied that 30 years after the end of the Cold War, NATO, a Cold War remnant and the worlds largest military alliance, continues to expand its geographical scope and the range of operations and engages in bloc politics and confrontation.This is not conducive to global security and stability, the spokesperson said, calling on NATO to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, respect the sovereignty, security, interests of other countries and do more to increase mutual trust among countries and maintain regional peace and stability.
