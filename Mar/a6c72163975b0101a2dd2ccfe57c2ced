The JIAT also denied the coalition's accountability for an attack on a health center in Yemen's Saada Governorate in 2015.Moreover, the team refuted a statement by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator that the coalition conducted an airstrike in Al-Jawf city in 2020, killing a number of civilians.The forces of the coalition were "correct" in procedures to attack a vehicle and two buildings of the Houthi militia during the airstrike as local intelligence indicated that no civilians were inside, which turned out to be otherwise.The JIAT recommended prosecuting the field commander who provided the inaccurate information, adding the coalition would provide assistance for the civilian victims.The outcomes of the investigations were announced on the same day as the launch of the Yemeni talks in Riyadh. Xinhua
