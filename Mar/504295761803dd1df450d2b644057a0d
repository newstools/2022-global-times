The presidential election is scheduled to be held in South Korea on March 9, 2022. It will be the eighth presidential election since democratization.

Some voters received ballot-papers that had already been used, while others had to wait in long queues in the cold weather, with at least one reported to have fainted.Opposition candidate Yoon's campaign criticized the NEC, saying, "an elementary classroom election could not be sloppier," and called for its chairwoman, Noh Jeong-hee, to step down.Lee's party, while dismissing the opposition's demand for Noh's resignation, also demanded steps to avert more confusion.South Koreans eligible to vote for a successor to Moon number about 44 million. He is legally barred from reelection, at a time of growing voter frustration at skyrocketing home prices, polarized politics and graft scandals.Reuters
