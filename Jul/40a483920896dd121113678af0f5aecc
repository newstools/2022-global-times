The Chinese charity has conducted six consecutive deliveries of aid to Afghanistan since last November.The FHKO, also raised money in China and locally procured about 160 bags of flour for 160 families.The charity's relief team finally arrived at a seriously hit county in Khost Province on Thursday after six hours of arduous journey and distributed the relief supplies to about half of the victims' families in the county who had not received any assistance yet, Wang Duanyong, the co-leader of the FHKO, told the Global Times on Thursday.Wang met with the governor of Khost Province and officials from the provincial health department who thanked Chinese NGOs for their assistance and sent a team of armed guards to help deliver the supplies.A collapsed house after the earthquake in Paktika Province, Afghanistan Photo: Courtesy of Qiu XuKhost is one of the three provinces most affected by the earthquake. However, compared with the Paktika Province, Khost has received less attention and global assistance partly due to its rugged terrain and inconvenient access that prevent more supplies to reach out, Zheng Gang, co-leader of the charity who initiated the fundraising campaign, told The Global Times.About 600 to 700 households in the county were affected, with 27 dead, 69 seriously injured and more than 600 lightly injured, the county head told Wang, noting that the damage is very serious due to the relatively poor quality of the local housing. Local infrastructure and communication equipment are also somewhat scarce, Zheng noted.Both charities say more supplies and aid are on the way.China vows to continue to monitor the disaster and post-disaster reconstruction in Afghanistan and is willing to provide more support based on the needs of the Afghan people, Zhao said on Tuesday's press briefing.
