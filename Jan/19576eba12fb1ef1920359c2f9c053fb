The move was part of a series of US-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords, pacts that have angered the Palestinians.  Prime Minister Naftali Bennett made history in December 2021 when he became the first Israeli head of government to visit UAE, in a trip that partly focused on international talks on Iran's nuclear program, a top Israeli security priority. Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, will be the first Israeli head of state to officially visit the UAE.The deals were negotiated under former US president Donald Trump but endorsed by President Joe Biden's administration.
