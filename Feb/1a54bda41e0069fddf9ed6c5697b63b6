Farmers harvest early rice in Yongfeng, East China's Jiangxi Province on Tuesday. In the heat of the summer rush, farmers are busy harvesting 420,000 mu (28,000 hectares) of mature early rice to ensure that these summer grains are put into silos. China has set a grain harvest goal of 650 million metric tons and has achieved the target for six years in a row.

The volume was equivalent to 24 percent of the country's total grain production, a historic high.A recent article published by the People's Daily stressed the importance of further securing adequate supplies of primary products, especially related to agricultural products, as China is still overly reliant on imports in certain areas.Guangxi's total grain output hit 13.865 million tons in 2021, and this figure is expected to reach a milestone of 15 million tons by 2035, according to an agricultural development report for 2021-30 issued by the local government.
