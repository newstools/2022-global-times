Biden blamed the previous administration for ballooning the deficit "with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations," and renewed his push for a reform in the tax system."The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it," he said. "I'm not looking to punish anyone. But let's make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share."Biden also reiterated key points in his economic agenda, urging Congress to pass legislation to create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program and raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and to allow every worker to organize or join a union and bargain collectively with their employer.Xinhua
