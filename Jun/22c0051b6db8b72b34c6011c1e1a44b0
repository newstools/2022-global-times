Rather, what is behind the US push to fight IUU is its political agenda of persuading countries that heavily rely on the fishing industry such as Southeast Asian countries, Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US is increasingly invested in disrupting, tracking and limiting China's maritime activities, using the name of fighting IUU, Song pointed out, citing US Coast Guard forces to Southeast Asia. Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, said that the US has used combating illegal fishing as a stunt for a long time to crack down on China's "Blue Economy" and other maritime activities.The "capacity building" could involve satellite technology mentioned in the IPMDA, as well as establishing an all-around monitoring of China's civil and military maritime activities, and the IUU fighting excuse would give such unwarranted move a civil camouflage, Chen Hong said.
