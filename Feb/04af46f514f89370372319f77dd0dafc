By accepting the case, the court sent a signal to detractors of the agency and, more broadly, opponents of strong government regulatory authority.In its brief to the court, West Virginia accused the EPA of acting like "the country's central energy planning authority."The EPA is "reshaping the power grids and seizing control over electricity production nationwide" without the express authorization of Congress, the state said.AFP
