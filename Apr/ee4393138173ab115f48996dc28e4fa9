Scenery of Solomon Islands Photo: ICFor decades, Australia, the "manager" of the United States in their South Pacific region "backyard," has been nakedly projecting its rampant hegemony by treating the island countries as vassals. Although the region has been "neglected" for long, as Australia's own official has admitted, when China tries to develop normal cooperation and economic exchanges there, Canberra, Washington and its allies cannot stop their hysteric attacks on China and the island governments who show friendliness to other countries outside the Western block.The security pact signed in late March between China and the Solomon Islands has been constantly obstructed by Australia, the hegemonic country in the South Pacific, with the US behind it. In a row, Australian and American envoys have visited the island country to put pressure, with Japan following soon.The Solomon Islands is now at the center but its Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has refused to compromise and called the denunciations from the West "insulting.""Australia has always viewed the South Pacific region as its own backyard, treating island countries as vassal states with a colonial mentality," said Chen Hong, President of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and Director of the Australian Studies Center at the East China Normal University.Trying to revive the Monroe Doctrine in the South Pacific region will get no support and lead to nowhere, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday.Experts noted that countless precedents have proved that when the US and its allies launch such an intensive "diplomatic siege" and "public opinion bombing" against a "smaller country," if it refuses to "compromise," it may face a blockade or even regime subversion.A tradition of bullyingLooking back on past decades, Australia has been keeping exerting political pressure and military influence on the countries in the South Pacific region and obstructing economic cooperation with others.Australia's hegemonic thinking of brazenly treating the independent Pacific island countries as its colonies or vassal states is sometimes more egregious and uglier than its American ally's, observers noted.A report published on Saturday on The Sydney Morning Herald suggested that Australian spies are behind the "leak of a draft" of the security pact between China and the Solomon Islands. According to the report, the Australian intelligence services "encouraged a leak" "as a last resort" to put pressure from domestic and international public opinion and force Sogavare to change his mind.To strengthen its military hegemony in the South Pacific region, Australia has been working with the US in the expansion of their naval and air bases in the area.In 2021, for instance it reportedly committed $175 million to upgrade the Lombrum naval base on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea. The base was jointly expanded by the US and Australia in recent years for stationing large warships.Earlier, Australian defence minister Christopher Pyne said that some Australian ships "would probably be based permanently at Lombrum," news outlet ABC reported in November 2018.Economic aid is another major means of Australia to strengthen its control over the Pacific island countries. As the largest donor in the Pacific Islands region, Australia provided $7 billion in bilateral aid to 16 countries of the region between 2006 and 2013, according to statistics by Sydney-based Lowy Institute. Its aid allocation to the Pacific islands countries was A$1.72 billion ($1.24 billion) in the 2020-21 fiscal year, a 56 percent increase from the fiscal year 2012-13, The Australian reported in April.To prevent countries in the region from diversifying economic cooperation, especially with China, Australia has been intimidating them with the cliche "China threat theory" or "debt trap" smear. In Fiji, Australia funded a military base in Nadi in 2018 and it "contributed a 'significant' figure" to "secure the rights as the sole foreign donor," The Australian reported in September that year.Australia also imported many seasonal laborers from the island countries. Though foreign exchanges have become the pillar of the economy of some smaller countries, they have also caused problems such as brain drain and lack of innovation in the economy. Moreover, media reported that the island laborers face hunger, poverty or exploitation in Australia, according to the Business Human Rights Resource Centre."This plan, which was meant to be a benefit for the islanders, has become an exploitation of them," Yang Honglian, senior researcher of the Pacific Islands Research Center at the Liaocheng University, based in Fiji, told the Global Times.This reminded many people of the dark history of the "blackbird" age in late 1800s and early 1900s, when more than 60,000 Pacific islanders, men, women and children, were transported, some kidnapped, to Australia to become laborers which is considered today by some political activists as "a form of slavery."'Color revolution' in islandsAustralia has long been openly infiltrating the government and judicial systems of Pacific Island countries, as well as local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), constantly spreading Western ideology and values to cultivate local people to be pro-Australian, Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the Research Center for Pacific Island Countries of the Liaocheng University, told the Global Times.Colluding with the US, Australia has tried to overthrow the leaders in the region it does not like with methods similar to color revolutions. The US diplomatic cables from 2006, which were exposed by WikiLeaks in 2011, revealed Washington's involvement in the "Australian government's campaign to oust then Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogavare."Around 2006, Sogavare called for the leaving of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) sent by the Australian government. The RAMSI was sent to the Solomon Islands in 2003 to help deal with the country's civil unrest at the time. However, it continued to stay there for years after the unrest subsided.Sogavare's stance against Western infiltration and intervention enraged Australia. Exposed cables showed that then Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, once called and told Sogavare, "I will make things very difficult for you and your government." Sogavare stepped down the following year in 2007.More recently, after the riots in Honiara in November 2021, Sogavare, told the press that the crisis "is influenced and encouraged by other powers." He further indicated that these forces are those that "do not want ties with the People's Republic of China."The same hegemonic approach by the West has been seen in other island countries.Over the last week, before visiting the Solomon Islands, White House Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell, landed in Fiji and Papua New Guinea in an attempt to spread the influence of Western countries."Currently these South Pacific countries are all facing their general election. It is clear that Australia, a proxy of the US in the region, will attempt to support anti-government forces in these countries, especially anti-China forces,"Chen said.For example, the Australian government and media used to carry out several public opinion attacks against the China-friendly leaders in Papua New Guinea, Chen pointed out."This kind of behavior is an interference in the domestic affairs of the island countries, which is completely contrary to the 'democratic equality' advocated by Australia and the US," Yang said."The political ecology of island countries is extremely fragile. Once the political situation is unstable, a series of public security problems will arise impacting local investment environment, causing deterioration of development and construction," Yang noted, highlighting that "this ultimately harms the interests of the people of the island countries."The pivot in the Indo-Pacific strategyActually, Australia and the US have "neglected" the Solomon Islands for years, as well as the South Pacific Region, but since China built diplomatic ties with the Solomon Islands in 2019, the island country has become the "favorite" target to act against China in the South Pacific region."Back in 2019, the US began to fall into a hysterical anxiety. The US government was afraid of a chain reaction that would make other puppets countries they manipulated in the region to switch sides," Chen said.He also noted that the current security cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands has triggered unprecedented attention from the US and Australia, but in the past, these two countries have long been gradually conceiving and putting into practice a new anti-China bloc in the South Pacific Ocean.The islands in the South Pacific Ocean hold the key to maritime traffic between Asia and North and South America and are of great military and strategic value, which the US regards as a significant military zone that must be controlled, Yu said.To protect their hegemonic system at a time of major shifts in power in the Asia-Pacific region, the US and its military allies are on one hand, building new large military bases in the region. On the other, they are doing their utmost to strengthen their military control over the South Pacific island countries, never allowing them to establish military and security cooperation with any non-Western countries, Yu criticized."In fact, the Indo-Pacific strategy in the South Pacific has nothing to do with the development of the island countries themselves. This is just a backup plan made by the US in case it loses the first island chain. Once China is reunified, the deployments of the US there will face an embarrassing situation," Yang said.Actually, without the involvement of China, the island countries would still be the target of looting by the colonists and would still be the place to have nuclear tests or dump nuclear waste, Yang noted.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that "China building a military base on Solomon Islands" would be a "red line" for Australia and the US, ABC reported on Sunday. "We will not be having Chinese military naval bases in our region on our doorstep," Morrison said.The handling of the situation in the Solomon Islands could also affect the situation in the upcoming elections in Australia, Yu noted.If the Morrison administration further "loses" the country, it will mean the failure of their hegemonic foreign policy in their "backyard," again, which will be used as an excuse for political opponents and rival parties to attack, Yu said. "But no matter which party is in power, their hegemonic foreign policy in the region will eventually fail."
