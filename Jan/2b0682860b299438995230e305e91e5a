We are fishermen and we can't commit to something we're not confident in delivering," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a break from planting mangrove saplings.His frustration shows the practical difficulties of channeling financing to rehabilitate nature where it is needed, even as more countries and donors invest in so-called "nature-based solutions," from reforestation to wetland expansion.New pledges Over the last decade, less than 1 percent of international climate finance has gone to indigenous and local communities to manage forests that absorb planet-heating carbon emissions and are rich in biodiversity, according to a recent report from green groups.Nature protection remains under-funded worldwide, with the UN urging a fourfold increase in annual investment to $536 billion by 2050, to tackle the triple threat of climate change, biodiversity and land degradation.Lately there has been a rise in pledges including at November 2021's UN COP26 climate summit, where about $19 billion was promised in public and private funding to protect and restore forests.In February 2022, a new global fund will be launched by the Rights and Resources Initiative and Campaign for Nature to help indigenous and local groups conserving forests and other ecosystems on the ground access international finance more easily.Environmentalist Meena Raman said making more small grants available to communities and partnering with local nonprofits to overcome language and knowledge barriers would channel money to places that have missed out in the past."Nature provides them with jobs, and they protect the ecosystem... It's about sustainable livelihoods and sustaining nature [at the same time]," said Raman, president of Friends of the Earth Malaysia.Boost for womenBack in Sungai Acheh, a sleepy village with wooden fishing boats along the river, women said they had also gained from the mangrove-planting initiative.A group of them has learned from mangrove-dwelling communities in Indonesia how to turn some of the tree species into tea, juice, and jam, selling the products for 6-8 ringgit each to boost their household income."It has not only helped my husband to increase his fishing catch, but I have benefited from it too," said Siti Hajar Abdul Aziz, 36, a mother of five.More coastal communities like hers would gain from protecting nature and improving their livelihoods, if they get financial support to champion similar initiatives, she added.Siti Hajar hopes one day to find ways to expand sales of her mangrove products by selling them in places like supermarkets."Before this I was just sitting at home. I have learned so much since I started doing this," she said.Reuters
