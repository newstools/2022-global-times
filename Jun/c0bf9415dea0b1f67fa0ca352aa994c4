The average daily flight volume increased by 17 percent month-on-month, and the top three airports are in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen.Market watchers predicted that more flights will resume operation in the coming days, as China is negotiating with more countries to lift travel restrictions put in place over the past two years.Meanwhile, China tweaked its COVID-19 prevention playbook to halve the quarantine time for close contacts and international arrivals from 14 days to seven days, which also gives much more confidence to the market.A gradual relaxation of the epidemic prevention policy can boost tourism as well as economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, Adam Li, vice president of Emirates Airline China, told the Global Times.Global Times
