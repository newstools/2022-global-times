They forcibly sent indigenous children to 'residential schools' for the purpose of assimilation. But indigenous children in these 'residential schools' were abused, many of whom died unnaturally, and the truth has been covered up to this day," Jiang said. Minister Jiang noted that however, countries in question have not yet taken effective measures to protect the rights of the indigenous people, with discriminatory legislations and policies still in force.Indigenous people in these countries are subject to systemic discrimination and inequality, and have been marginalized at every level of society. Their disadvantaged position further deteriorated under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, he noted. "We urge countries in question to immediately act to correct their wrongs, investigate human rights violations against indigenous people, hold those responsible accountable, redress the victims, and eliminate completely discrimination against indigenous people," said Jiang. "We call upon the Human Rights Council to continue to attend to serious human rights violations against indigenous people by countries in question and take necessary actions accordingly," he said. Global Times
