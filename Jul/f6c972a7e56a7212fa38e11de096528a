It was successfully deployed into water and accurately positioned in the eastern part of South China Sea in April. Haiji One serves as a pedestal holding a massive offshore oil drilling platform, and is expected to help increase offshore oil and gas production. "The construction took more than 28 months, completing the construction and installation of core facilities such as a 30,000-ton conduit frame, eight superstructures and 25.6 kilometers of subsea pipelines, with more than 1,000 people involved at peak times," said Yuan Wei, deputy general manager of CNOOC Shenzhen, as quoted by CCTV.Haiji One is expected to be put into operation later in the year to serve the Lufeng 15-1 oil field platform located in the South China Sea. It will inject new momentum into the economic and social development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area and further improve China's energy security capacity, according to CCTV.Global Times
