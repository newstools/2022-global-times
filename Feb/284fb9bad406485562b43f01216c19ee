Some sports commentators played down expectations by saying the Freeski Big Air is not Gu's strongest hand.  Gu's performance was steady and faultless in the first two runs, giving her a good score for a podium finish.On her final run, which has made Chinese spectators breathless, Gu nailed a double cork 1620, with unprecedented difficulty, to take over the first spot, surpassing the Mathilde Gremaud of Switzerland who finished third and Tess Ledeux of France who got the Silver. Besides the fierce competition, the adorable post-game moment touched many people's hearts. Gu and Gremaud were consoling Tess Ledeux. "Such class, compassion and camaraderie amongst these athletes … You love to see it," said Associate Editor of The Athletic Lukas Weese on Twitter. Gu’s gold medal also inspired Chinese netizens on Sina Weibo, in which discussions about Gu exploded with over 22 million reads and millions of comments soon after her historic victory. "Congratulations! No one can stop a genius who tries her best to challenge herself," said a Weibo user. "Every time I see her on TV, she's smiling and confident and optimistic, which is really inspiring to us," said another. Gu is also favored to win gold medals in the upcoming Women's Freeski Slopestyle and Women's Freeski Halfpipe skiing events at Beijing 2022.Beijing has provided the perfect court conditions and the weather has been perfect over the past few days, with perfect visibility, light and wind, bringing out the best in the players, a Beijing-based sports commentator told the Global Times on Tuesday. "All the elite athletes were trying to do the higher difficulty, and only Gu's challenge succeeded. That is why she is the champion … this gold will accumulate a psychological advantage of Gu for the next two events," the commentator said."They are not only athletes but also the best girls on the planet in skiing … their sensational performances will promote the public participation in the winter sports, their happiness to constantly push the limits will be passed to the audience who can feel the charm of ice and snow," said a netizen.  "It is the pure love that makes her go from amateur to Olympic champion!" said the commentator.
