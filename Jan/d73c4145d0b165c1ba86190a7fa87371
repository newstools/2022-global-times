It comes after the Spanish government declared a state of emergency in Madrid to try and halt the spread of coronavirus in one of Europe's most significant outbreaks.

The funds are at the heart of the economic and political strategy of Sanchez's government after the economy contracted by a whopping 10.8 percent in 2020 under its watch as the pandemic hit.The government faces elections by the end of 2023.But some business leaders and opposition parties have complained about a lack of coordination between the central government and Spain's powerful regions over the deployment of the money.Although Spain was the first to receive aid, the money was "not injected" as fast as expected in the "real economy," the CEOE employers' association said in a report in early January.By the end of the year, only 38 percent of the funds allocated to Spain for 2021 had been used, official figures show.This is "very far from the targets" that were set and the delay in using the aid will hamper growth, think tank Funcas has warned. Aerospace giant Airbus complained of a lag in the allotment of the funds, citing a "lack of coordination and leadership" from the responsible ministries, according to an internal memo published in El Pais newspaper in December.Critics also say that even when the money is distributed, it is often not well spent, with small amounts spread across many projects."The current assignment system for the funds" leads to their "dispersion" and favors "little projects," some of them "a bit odd," said the Exceltur tourism association's vice president, Jose Luis Zoreda.He cited as an example a golf course in the rainy northern region of Asturias. To have a "real impact," the funds should focus on "a few large projects" with a strong potential to "transform" the Spanish economy, he added. The row has in recent days become political, with the right-wing opposition Popular Party (PP) accusing the government of favoring regions and municipalities run by the left."Two years ago we proposed setting up an independent agency for managing EU funds" as happened in Greece, Italy and France, PP leader Pablo Casado said."But Sanchez preferred to distribute aid arbitrarily," he charged. Casado and several right-wing regional leaders have threatened to take the government to court over the distribution of the EU money, accusing it of "favoritism."
