He said Vietnam hopes that consultations of the three maritime working groups of the two sides will make substantive progress, giving priority to advancing maritime delimitation in the sea area outside the mouth of the Beibu Bay.Both China and Vietnam are well aware that they are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each other. So the differences on the boundary issue need to be well managed so as to develop common interests and ensure mutual security, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday.Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries so the cooperation between the two sides has a solid foundation, Li said, adding that the two sides are also partners in maintaining regional order and stability, as well as economic complementarities and reciprocity.  After the two ministers exchanged views on the Ukraine issue, which has made Asian countries realize that maintaining peace is precious and indulging in bloc confrontation will lead to endless risks, Wang Yi warned the risk of regional tension and antagonism with the US' pushing of the "Indo-Pacific Strategy." Such moves will seriously damage the hard-won peace and development in the region and seriously erode the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture, Wang said, noting that the two countries should not let the Cold War mentality resurge in the region and the tragedy like Ukraine's happen in the region. The US has been trying to undermine the coordination and cooperation between ASEAN members and China at a deeper economic and security level by taking advantage of the differences between individual countries and China, Li said. "This is a manifestation of the Cold War mentality, which has caused military conflict in Europe."  Li said once the COC is reached and put into practice, the exchanges and cooperation between countries in the region will be smoother, the degree of economic integration will be higher, the degree of mutual dependence on security will also be higher, which will effectively weaken the ability of the US to sow discord.
