Zhao Lijian Photo: VCG The US should abide by the provisions of the Three Joint Communiqués, stop hollowing out the one-China principle, stop supporting "Taiwan independence" forces, and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-US relations, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday when responding to whether the Taiwan question and Xinjiang-related issues will be discussed at the upcoming China-US foreign ministers' meeting.At a regular press conference on Wednesday, Zhao said that the Taiwan question concerns China's core interests and has always been the most important and sensitive topic in China-US relations. The US should abide by the provisions of the Three Joint Communiqués and stop trying to turn back the wheel of history, Zhao said, as successive US governments have made a clear commitment to this, and President Biden has also stated that the US does not support "Taiwan independence."The so-called forced labor in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is a big lie fabricated by the US to discredit and contain China, Zhao said. Zhao pointed out to the press that it is not China that is engaged in "forced labor," but the US that is engaged in forced unemployment, depriving hundreds of thousands of workers in Xinjiang of their most basic right to work in various industries. It is not China that oppresses human rights, but the US that forces people to return to poverty and undermines the livelihood of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang who have shake off poverty. It is not China that is violating international rules, but the US that is forcing a "decouple" with China, violating international economic and trade rules and undermining the stability of international industrial and supply chains.The US should stop fabricating lies about "forced labor," suspend the implementation of the "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act," and take concrete actions to create favorable conditions for bilateral cooperation in various fields, instead of creating new obstacles, Zhao stressed.
