No matter how it is packaged or disguised, it will be doomed to failure," Wang said. Asia-Pacific countries generally prefer not to take sides as the prevailing voice is to pursue harmony and win-win cooperation, and current trend is to prompt regional integration and build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, Wang said.Facing turbulent international affairs, China-Pakistan solidarity is of great importance to safeguard the security and stability of the region, Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday. Bilawal agreed with Wang that the two countries will strengthen an open and inclusive regional cooperation framework, resolve hotspot issues through dialogue and consultation and called for mutual respect rather than a Cold War mentality and camp confrontation.
