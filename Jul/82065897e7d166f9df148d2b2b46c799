Sri Lanka's six-time prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in Thursday as president of the crisis-hit South Asian nation, as officials said he was looking to form a unity government to manage the turmoil.The 73-year-old veteran politician, who was overwhelmingly elected as head of state in a parliamentary vote Wednesday, took his oath of office before Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, his office said.Live coverage of the swearing-in at the parliament complex was cut off just as Wickremesinghe and his wife Maithree walked into the building after reviewing a military parade."An investigation was launched to figure out why the broadcast was ­interrupted," a top defense official told AFP.Sri Lanka's police chief and top ­military brass stood behind the new president as the oath was administered.Official sources said he was expected to shortly form a cabinet not exceeding 30 ministers to steer the country out of its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain.Sri Lanka is in the midst of severe ­economic turmoil and has sought ­assistance from the International Monetary Fund and nations to supply basic ­essentials such as fuel, gas and medicines.On Wednesday, Wickremesinghe invited all political parties to join hands with him and work together to overcome the economic crisis and bring in a new political change.Wickremesinghe is widely expected to invite his schoolmate and former public administration minister Dinesh Gunawardena to be the prime minister in the unity government.Gunawardena and Wickremesinghe have known each other since the age of 3 and studied together at the prestigious Royal College of Colombo."There will be a few MPs from the main opposition joining the cabinet," a source close to Wickremesinghe said, adding that he was keen to ensure a rainbow coalition.
