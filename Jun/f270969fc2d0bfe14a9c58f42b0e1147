The extension passed with 67 votes in favor out of a possible 84, with 15 against."We are determined to support not just one more [extension] but as many as are necessary at the government's request because that is what the people are asking for," Christian Guevara, head of the president's New Ideas party, said on Monday.Multiple surveys show that 70 percent of Salvadorans support the government's current measures to reduce gang crime. Two previous extensions of the state of emergency were each for one month.In the three months since it began, security forces have arrested more than 41,300 people, including 1,190 minors, for allegedly belonging to or collaborating with the gangs, official data show.At least 18 people had died in police custody by late May, according to human rights groups. Some nonprofit organizations argued that current levels of violence in the Central American nation did not warrant another 30-day extension.Reuters
