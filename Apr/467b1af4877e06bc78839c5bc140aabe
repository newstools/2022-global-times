Supply is no longer the issue. The legacy of all the supply constraint from 2021 - the effects of that [are] still being felt," she said.SAGE said vaccination coverage among the groups most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease was not enough to give them the protection they needed.Health worker coverage is at 65 percent overall."That's certainly a very, very strong position to be in, but we're really carrying the message forward that it needs to be 100 percent," said O'Brien.Coverage in the over-60s is at 69 percent.So far, the WHO has authorized eight COVID-19 vaccines and versions thereof, giving them the green light with its emergency use listing (EUL) status.SAGE said that available data on their effectiveness against the Omicron variant of COVID-19 generally showed waning immunity against infection but high and more sustained effectiveness against severe disease and death. However, it added: "Data remains very limited for some of the WHO EUL vaccines" in their performance against Omicron.AFP
