As China's first national exhibition focusing on high-end consumer products, the CICPE contributes to the dual circulation development strategy by enabling global high-quality brands to get access to China's huge consumption market," Fabrice Megarbane, president of L'Oréal North Asia Zone and CEO of L'Oréal China, said on Tuesday in a speech at the L'Oréal booth opening ceremony."We believe the strategic position of Hainan will help unleash the great potential of the Chinese consumption market, especially with people's increasing aspirations for beauty with the world's largest middle class here in China," Megarbane said. Beauty products sat atop the overall Hainan duty-free goods sales ranking in 2021.Multiple major French businesses spanning fashion, retail, spirits and beverages revealed plans to expand in the world's second-largest consumer market."We have plans to expand our retail network in China to 200 stores within three years from the current 80," Mark Lu, president of Daniel Hechter Greater China, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The French fashion and lifestyle brand has been present in the Chinese market for 18 years, with its current footholds encapsulating Beijing, Shanghai, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Hainan free trade port, according to Lu.Daniel Hechter will open two more outlets in the country's largest duty-free shopping complex in Haikou later this year, bringing its presence in Hainan to 10 outlets, Lu disclosed. The French brand eyes an expansion into second-tier Chinese cities in the years to come, where people's demand for luxury items would continue to grow along with the economy's rebalancing to be consumption-oriented, he said.In the case of upmarket French department store chain Galeries Lafayette, a second-time participant in the CICPE, its vision is to beef up its department store network in China to 10 locations by 2025, according to Lawrance Shum, CEO of Galeries Lafayette China. After the setup of two flagships - one in Beijing in 2013 and the other in Shanghai in 2019 - new stores in Shenzhen, Macao and Chongqing are in the works, Shum said."With the construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port in full swing and the offshore duty-free policy fueling Hainan tourism industry, Hainan offers vast business opportunities to international companies," France-based wind and spirits group Pernod Ricard said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.
