China sold some normal military goods to Serbia. How would that harm regional peace and stability?"If the military goods were indeed air defense missiles, they are for defensive purposes, and other countries have no reason to badmouth Serbia's normal national defense development, as Serbia used to be a victim of air raids, Fu pointed out.On March 24, 1999, NATO started a 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia, causing thousands of casualties including three Chinese citizens, and displacing hundreds of thousands. Twenty-three years on, the US-driven NATO did not stop its expansion and aggression, fanning the flames of the Ukraine crisis and pressing China with groundless accusations.
