Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian Photo: fmprc.gov.cnIndividual media should not attack and smear China by making a deliberate misinterpretation and maliciously hyping it up, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said as he commented on the Washington Post's latest report that "China has warned foreign Olympic athletes of punishment if they speak out on politics at the Winter Games." The Washington Post cited Yang Shu, deputy director general of international relations for the Beijing Organising Committee, as saying in a news conference on Tuesday that "any behavior or speech that is against the Olympic spirit, especially against the Chinese laws and regulations, is subject to certain punishment."Although the report pointed out that China's stance falls in line with the IOC's established rule against political protest at the Games, it alleged that China's rule appeared to be "a shade stricter than that of the IOC's."In response to media question on this issue, Zhao said on Wednesday's press briefing that the IOC had issued a statement about the ban on political protests, requiring Olympic athletes not to, for example, get down on one knee on the field or on the podium to protest. Zhao said he hopes individual media not to attack and smear China by quoting IOC rules out of context. He reiterated that China welcomes athletes from all countries to participate in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and will ensure the safety and convenience of all athletes. China is confident it'll present a simple, safe and splendid Olympic Games to the world, Zhao said. Global Times
