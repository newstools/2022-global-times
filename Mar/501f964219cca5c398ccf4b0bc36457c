Gao Feng, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce, at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday Photo: Li Qiaoyi/GTChinese officials on Thursday called on the US to immediately stop unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and vowed to take "necessary" measures to protect Chinese businesses, in response to the US' latest crackdown against Chinese telecommunications firms.The US Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) said on Wednesday in an official notice that it had revoked the authorization of Pacific Network Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide interstate and international telecommunications services in the US market.The FCC's order directed the Chinese company to discontinue any domestic or international services that it provides pursuant to its Section 214 authority within 60 days following the release of the order.At a press briefing in Beijing on Thursday, Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), said that the US has continued to misuse the concept of national security, abuse its power and maliciously suppress Chinese telecom companies, violating the most basic principles of non-discrimination and fair competition, as well as international economic and trade rules."This harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and consumers, including American users, and China firmly opposes it," Gao said.He urged the US to immediately halt its unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the wrong practice of politicizing economic and trade issues to create a fair and stable market environment for enterprises of all countries to operate in the US market."China will take the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises," said the MOFCOM spokesperson.Also on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stressed that the US' unreasonable crackdown on Chinese enterprises is a serious breach of international trade and economic rules.Zhao said that the Chinese government supports relevant enterprises to safeguard their rights and interests in accordance with the law, and will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.This is not the first time the US government has targeted Chinese telecom companies. In March 2021, the FCC revoked the authorization of China Unicom (Americas) Corp, Pacific Network Corp and ComNet to provide services in the US, alleging the companies are controlled by the Chinese government and pose security risks - claims that have been repeatedly debunked by Chinese companies and officials.
