Vaccinated motorists line up to cross the border at the San Ysidro crossing port on the Mexico-US border in Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, on November 7, 2021. The US on Monday reopened its land borders with Mexico and Canada to foreigners vaccinated against COVID-19, almost 20 months after they were closed to non-essential traffic.

But "it really makes no sense to us," the official said, because keeping Title 42 would prevent the government from using powers of expedited removal under Title 8.That "is going to prevent us from adequately preparing for the aggressive application of immigration law when the public health order expires," the official said in a statement.Immigration pressure has surged over the past two years, with border officials pushing back each month as 220,000 people seeking to cross the border from Mexico.Most of them are from Central and South America, but many come from as far as South Asia and, most recently, Ukraine.The officials said they were boosting coordination with Central American countries where most of the migrants transit to slow the northward flow and return migrants to their home countries, and broadening efforts to crack down on migrant smuggling groups.AFP
