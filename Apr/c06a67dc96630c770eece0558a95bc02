Wang expressed strong opposition to some Australian politicians' smearing of China and provoking China's relations with other countries."Rather than preaching fake information on China for personal political purposes, I suggest some Australian politicians to honestly answer the concerns of people at home and abroad," said Wang.Far from backyards of the US or Australia, South Pacific island countries have independent sovereignty and planting Monroeism won't work in the region, Wang noted.Since Chinese Foreign Ministry on April 19 confirmed the signature of the security cooperation framework agreement between China and the Solomon Islands, China has been repeatedly emphasizing the legitimacy, transparency and openness of the security pact, refuting the endless slandering and smear from the US and Australia and explaining that the pact's aim is the social stability and good governance in the Solomon Islands, without targeting at any third party.
