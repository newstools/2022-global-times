The Chinese price of praseodymium-neodymium alloy used to make super strong magnets for EV motors has risen 32 percent so far this year to 1.38 million yuan ($218,395.90), according to a Reuters report. Industry players told the Global Times that disrupted rare-earth imports from Myanmar, an important source of these minerals in China, also helped maintain the prices of the scarce materials at a high level.A manager at a Ganzhou-based state-owned rare-earth company surnamed Yang told the Global Times that the delivery of rare earths from Myanmar to Ganzhou has not been very smooth, and kept "on and off.""There is a shortage of labor and chemical agents in Myanmar rare-earth mines, which also weighs on mineral supply," Yang said. He added that although almost all rare-earth manufacturers in Ganzhou are running at full capacity, the soaring demand in downstream industries further exacerbates the imbalance between supply and demand."High global inflation, the coronavirus situation, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and China's green push which will inevitable raise costs for firms, will provide the basis for rare-earth prices in the coming days," Wu told the Global Times on Friday.
