Any illicit activities, including spreading false information and price speculation, will be met with strict penalties. Aside from enhancing inspections targeting illicit activities, multiple departments including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the NDRC announced further adjustment of iron ore pricing mechanisms and the iron ore futures market in an outline published on Tuesday.The three ministries vowed to improve the amount and quality of steel products, which will rely on a stable iron ore supply. The outline stated plans to boost the capacity and output of domestic iron ore mines as well as increase international cooperation in overseas iron ore mines and import volume. In order to expand the steel and iron ore market, China will continuously follow the principle of achieving carbon emissions reductions. Regulators called on production enterprises to apply advanced technologies to raise production efficiency and fully reuse scrap steel to reduce carbon emissions. The outline also set a goal of building a steel and iron ore market with an advanced industry structure, stable resources supply and low carbon emissions by 2025. Global Times
