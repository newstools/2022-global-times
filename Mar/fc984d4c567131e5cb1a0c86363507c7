China stands ready to work with the EU to push for the investment deal to be ratified and come into force, and therefore the deal will benefit companies and people from both sides as soon as possible, the MOFCOM spokesperson said.During the first two months of 2022, the EU regained its position as China's top trading partner, with bilateral exports and imports growing 12.4 percent to 874.64 billion yuan ($138.34 billion), accounting for 14.1 percent of the country's total trade, customs data showed. In comparison, China's trade with the ASEAN increased by 10.5 percent to 870.47 billion yuan during the period. The MOFCOM's latest remarks indicate that both sides are still hoping to make headway on the CAI, although the deal still faces some challenges in moving forward, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday. In May 2021, the European Parliament voted through a motion to freeze the ratification process, putting the brakes on ratifying the massive deal that is envisioned to assist the 27-nation bloc's economic recovery amid lingering COVID-19 woes.There remain different opinions within the European Parliament as to whether to revoke the unilateral freeze, Cui said.It would require procedural efforts for the parliament to change its stance, he noted, downplaying the possibility of a course reversal in the near future.The CAI talks kicked off in late 2013, with 35 rounds of official negotiations held before the two sides completed negotiations on the mega investment deal at the end of 2020.Global Times
