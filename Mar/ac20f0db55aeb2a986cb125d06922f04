The government had recommended the governor-general declare the floods a national emergency, he said.Morrison, who is trailing in polls ahead of a federal election before May, on Wednesday made private visits to a flooded farm, the office of an emergency crew and also met with a person who lost their home, media reports said.Television footage showed some people gathered in front of an emergency operations center, where Morrison was due to visit, yelling "the water is rising, no more compromising" and "fossil fuel floods." Morrison's conservative government in late 2021 adopted a net zero carbon emissions target by 2050, but climate activists are demanding more aggressive action.In 2020, Morrison was criticized for taking a family holiday in Hawaii during the fire emergency and was later heckled by angry residents of a bushfire-hit town over fire service funding and a lack of assistance.A large swathe of Australia's east coast has been inundated after a second intense low-pressure system in as many weeks led to fast-rising floodwaters that cut off entire communities and trapped many people in their homes.Frustrated residents, with no access to power and internet for several days, have blamed authorities for the slow speed and scale of relief efforts. Major flooding continues in Sydney's western suburbs, although thousands of residents in Sydney's northeast returned to their homes after the rain eased."Thankfully, the rain has eased, and we'll see water levels continue to slowly recede in the coming days," Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Dean Narramore told reporters.Australia's east coast summer has been dominated by the La Nina weather phenomenon, typically associated with greater rainfall, with most rivers at near capacity even before the latest drenching.Sydney has received nearly 900 millimeters of rain so far in 2022, or about 80 percent of its annual rainfall, official data showed, the wettest start to a year since records began.Reuters
