With Ukraine as the keyword, the Global Times found that at least eight A-share listed companies have revealed business relations with Ukraine in announcements in the past year. This includes Yiling Pharmaceutical, Shanghai Fuhong Hanlin Biological Medicine Co and Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products.Ukraine is among the top pharmaceutical markets, with many clinical trials underway. Clinical centers can be launched there quickly, the operating costs are lower than in western European countries, and people are more willing to participate in the tests, experts said.More than 660 clinical trials are ongoing, planned or recruiting participants in Ukraine, according to the registry platform Clinical Trials.However as the tension in the region escalates, experts warned of a lasting impact on the multi-center clinical operations of pharmaceutical companies in Ukraine."It is unlikely that Ukraine's society and economy will return to normal any time soon and as a result the clinical trials are likely be disrupted by rising costs or social disorder," Wang Chishen, an independent economist, told the Global Times on Tuesday.
