The Israeli ministry of foreign affairs did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Israel captured East Jerusalem including the Old City in a 1967 war and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally.Palestinians want East Jerusalem for the capital of a state they seek in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which abuts the city, and the Gaza Strip. Israel views the entire city as its indivisible capital.Most world powers deem the Israeli settlements illegal for taking in territory where Palestinians seek statehood. The four countries also expressed concern about the evictions and demolitions in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where residents say they are being displaced. Earlier Wednesday, Israeli police evicted a Palestinian family from their East Jerusalem home before a digger tore down the property, prompting criticism from rights activists and diplomats.
