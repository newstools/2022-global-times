"I think it's disgraceful, forcing vaccination on people who don't want it."The demonstration remained peaceful, with police reporting no arrests or major incidents.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had no intention of entering discussions with convoy participants, arguing that the majority of New Zealanders had shown their support for the government's vaccination program."Ninety-six percent of New Zealanders have gone out and got a vaccination, which has enabled us to live now with fewer restrictions because of the extra protection that has provided," she told Radio New Zealand.COVID-19 vaccinations are mandatory for people working in certain sectors in New Zealand, such as health, law enforcement, education and defense.AFP
