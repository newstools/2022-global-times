Automobile exports expanded 194.4 percent to 24.26 billion yuan and those of mobile phones and lithium-ion batteries doubled to 19.55 billion yuan and 3.38 billion yuan, respectively.A key hub for the country's integrated circuit industry, Shanghai's import of integrated circuits hit 78.04 billion yuan, up 18.3 percent while exports shot up 18.6 percent to 43.15 billion yuan.The figures underscored Shanghai's leading role in China's foreign trade, which expanded 10.7 percent to 9.42 trillion yuan during the first quarter, Chen Jia, a research fellow with the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday.However, the Omicron outbreak that hit the city in March is expected to have a great impact on Shanghai's foreign trade in April and the second quarter, with heavy blows to manufacturing industries like automobiles, Chen said.Congestion at ports is also expected to add to the economic toll, he said.Official data show that since the end of March, throughput of goods for import or export dropped to 35 percent at sea ports and 49.1 percent at airports in Shanghai, compared with the previous levels, as epidemic control measures limited the distribution capacity of ports.On Saturday, Shanghai announced the first batch of 666 "whitelist" companies to resume work, which covered more than 200 auto parts companies and 80 semiconductor companies. Global Times
