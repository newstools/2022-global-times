The system has stored a huge amount of personal information and is key to the capital city’s ongoing efforts to curb the virus, netizens pointed out on Weibo. The attacks may aim to “acquire private information of Beijing residents” and “jeopardize Beijing’s epidemic prevention works and create chaos among the public,” one netizen posted.The Jiankangbao system was rolled out in 2020 after the initial COVID-19 outbreak. It is the official health status checking system for Beijing residents, providing a slew of services including health code, nucleic acid test result, and vaccination status. To better ensure that people exposed to the virus do not mix with the public, the system grants yellow or red codes to those who have had contact with or shared travel history with infected people. A health reminder will pop up if people have visited medium- or high-risk regions within the past 14 days, or if they have arrived from overseas.
