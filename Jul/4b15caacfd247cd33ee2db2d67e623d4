It is 100 percent controlled by China Rare Earth Group Co."The establishment of an international trade branch signals further integration of the rare-earth industry, which will be conducive to the strict import and export management of the strategic material," Wu Chenhui, an independent rare-earth industry analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday.With improved management of the further concentrated industry, China will have more competitiveness and stronger pricing power in the international market, according to Wu.China Rare Earth Group Co was formally set up in December 2021 through the merger of several key producers of the important mineral resources, involving China Minmetals Corp, Aluminum Corp of China and Ganzhou Rare Earth Group Co.When the industrial conglomerate was established, it announced its focus would center on technological research and development, exploration, downstream application and rare-earth trade.In sign of sound and sustainable development of the domestic rare-earth industrial and supply chains, the move will avoid the blind outflow of the valuable resources in the digital era, Wang Guoqing, research director at Beijing Lange Steel Information Research Center, told the Global Times.Rare earths, dubbed "industrial gold," are a group of 17 chemical elements used in a wide range of products from high-tech consumer electronics to military equipment.China leads the world's rare-earth sector in terms of production and refining technologies.
