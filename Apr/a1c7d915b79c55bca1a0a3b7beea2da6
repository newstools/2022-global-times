As he was being driven to a police station, he allegedly grabbed the arm of a police officer, causing the car to swerve, and elbowed another officer in the abdomen.Reed pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying he remembers nothing of the incident. Russian television meanwhile reported that Yaroshenko had already arrived back in the country, showing him in an emotional reunion with his wife Victoria and their daughter Ekaterina at a Moscow airport. The pilot was arrested in Liberia in 2010 for drug trafficking, then transferred to the US, where he was sentenced to 20 years in prison in September 2011.AFP
