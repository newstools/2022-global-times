The lawyers said they will file a motion for reconsideration with COMELEC with a full bench of judges.The complaint is among several filed by groups seeking the expulsion of Marcos, a career politician who has served as congressman, senator and a provincial governor, mostly over a 1995 conviction for tax violations while in public office, which petitioners had argued meant a lifetime election ban.The other petitions are pending with COMELEC's first division."We thank the Commission on Elections for upholding the law and the right of every bona fide candidate like Bongbong Marcos to run for public office free from any form of harassment and discrimination," Marcos's spokesman, Vic Rodriguez said in a statement, referring to the candidate's nickname.
