What the international community needs most is solidarity and cooperation and what the region most looks forward to is peace and stability, the spokesperson said in a statement issued on Monday.However, Biden's visit to Japan has shown us that, under the guise of a "free and open Indo-Pacific," Japan and the US are actually creating divisions, inciting confrontations and closing up exclusive circles. This goes completely against the trend of the times and damages the overall interests of the countries of the region which definitely will not work, the spokesperson said, urging Japan and the US not to be obsessed with zero-sum games and camp confrontation, not to pursue their own security at the expense of other countries' security, and not to allow the outdated Cold War rhetoric to repeat itself in the Asia-Pacific region.China will never allow any country to interfere in China's domestic affairs, damage China's interests and smear China's image, the spokesperson said, noting that the China-Japanese ties are at a crossroad. China urges Japan to correct its attitude toward China, correct its strategic direction and handle the relationships between China and the US in a balanced manner.The two leader underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits in a joint statement issued after their meeting on Monday. US President Joe Biden said during a press conference that it was his expectation that China would not try to seize control of the island of Taiwan by force.In response, the spokesperson stressed that the island of Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and that the Taiwan question is related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, concerns its core interests and it brooks no interference by any foreign force.The current tense and turbulent situation across the Taiwan Straits is rooted in the fact that the DPP authority refuses to recognize the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle and continues to engage in provocations for "independence" by colluding with external forces, the spokesperson said.We are willing to do our best to strive for a peaceful reunification but we will never leave any space for "Taiwan independence" separatist activities in any form, the spokesperson said, urging the US to take concrete actions to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, be cautious in its words and deeds, and stop sending erroneous signals to "Taiwan independence" forces.The spokesperson also noted the Taiwan question involves the political foundation of China-Japanese relations and the proper handling of the Taiwan question is the premise and basis for the normalization of China-Japanese ties.At a joint press conference, Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Funio Kishida, "reaffirmed that any attempt to change the status quo by force is absolutely impermissible, regardless of the location," and that they oppose such attempts in the East China Sea, including the "Senkaku Islands" (China's Diaoyu Islands), and the disputed South China Sea.In response, the spokesperson said that whatever the US and Japan say or do, they cannot change the fact that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China.China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea have sufficient historical and legal basis and conform to international law and practice, the spokesperson said.Biden on Monday announced the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework during his visit to Japan.The spokesperson said that the framework is doomed to fail if the US aims to use it to attack and destroy the current regional cooperation structure, politicize, weaponize, and ideologize economic issues and create division and confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region to isolate and exclude China.As to the comments of both leaders on China's nuclear power, the spokesperson said that the two countries, on one hand, vowed to enhance nuclear threats, but on the other, kept making irresponsible remarks on China's nuclear policies that are ultimately aimed to shirk responsibility and shift attention.
