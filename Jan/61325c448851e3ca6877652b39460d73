Illustration: Xia Qing/GTMany Chinese people can't wait to go back home as the Spring Festival approaches. There was a time when the "motorcycle army" occupied travel routes home during Spring Festivals. Compared with previous years, however, the scale of the "army" has recently been shrinking. Security problems remain top concerns for the motorcyclists' families and transportation departments. But they've been much less worried in recent years because of the rapid development of Chinese transportation infrastructure, including the high-speed rail network and township roads. People have more choices for returning home, besides travelling by train. More people working away from home prefer driving as there are more high-standard highways with free access for private cars during holidays. From the "green-skinned train" to high-speed rail, from motorcycles to private cars, the upgrades are the result of social progress and the improved income level of the residents. The downsizing of the "motorcycle army" is inspiring evidence of the advancement of Chinese society.
