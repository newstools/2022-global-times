CanSinoBIO's vaccine Photo: VCGCONVIDECIA, a vaccine produced by Chinese manufacturer CanSino Biologics, showed a 95.35 percent efficacy in preventing intensive care unit admission 28 days following the administration of one shot, according to a real world study conducted in Chile.The efficacy was similar to the 96.56 percent of two doses of Pfizer mRNA vaccine after 14 days and higher than the 86.88 percent of two shots of inactivated vaccines after 14 days, according to a statement released by the company on Monday.Another real world study, which was conducted in Mexico from March to December 2021, when the Delta variant was dominating, showed that the efficacy of CONVIDECIA in preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, hospitalization and death was 48 percent, 76 percent and 94 percent, respectively, according to the statement.Despite the decline in time of prevention of symptomatic disease and new mutations, one single shot of CONVIDECIA still shows about 93 percent efficacy in preventing death four months after administration, read the statement.CanSino Biologics' shot is based on a modified human adenovirus that expresses the spike S protein of SARS-CoV-2. It is administered as a single dose.Researchers have found that CONVIDECIA can induce a potent neutralizing activity against the wild-type virus and the Omicron variant when used as a booster as it proved to be a better choice for mixed vaccination.The World Health Organization (WHO) issued an emergency use listing for CONVIDECIA in May, making it the third Chinese vaccine validated by the organization for the prevention of COVID-19.It is also China's first third-generation COVID-19 vaccine approved by the WHO which uses a relatively harmless, unrelated virus called adenovirus that has been engineered to carry DNA encoding the desired viral protein target, such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, according to a statement by CanSino Biologics.
