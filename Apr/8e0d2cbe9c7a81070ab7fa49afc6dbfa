Be it "authorized" or "ordered" departure, it is the US' own decision, Zhao said. However, Zhao stressed that China's epidemic prevention and control policy is scientific and effective. "We are fully confident that Shanghai and other places will prevail over the new round of the COVID-19 outbreak," he said. Many foreign nationals based in Shanghai, including those from the US, are pulling together with the people of Shanghai in solidarity to combat the virus and overcome the current difficulties, Zhao said. Relevant Chinese departments and local governments have been providing assistance to foreign diplomatic and consular personnel in China as far as possible in accordance with relevant international conventions and policies, according to the spokesperson. The channels of communication between China and the US are also unimpeded, he said.Monday's order comes after the State Department announced on Friday that non-emergency personnel could voluntarily leave the consulate.
