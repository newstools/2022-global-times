The issuance of 43,600 RCEP certificates of origin expected to reduce tariffs for RCEP members importing Chinese products by $31 million, Feng said. The exported commodities include clothing items and accessories, chemicals, plastics and corresponding products.Feng further noted that RCEP also enriches the form of certificate of origin, diversifying the declaration methods in which exporters and producers can independently issue declarations of origin and improving the trade efficiency and convenience. Global Times
