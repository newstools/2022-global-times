"When you speak to Russia you are speaking to your banker."Le Pen replied that she was "an absolutely and totally free woman," arguing that her party had only taken that loan as it could not find financing in France where banks refused to lend to her.Macron adopted a variety of poses to express skepticism at her arguments, raising his eyebrows, leaning his chin on his fists and lamenting in apparent bewilderment "Madame Le Pen... Madame Le Pen!" The most explosive clash came when Le Pen confirmed she was sticking to her controversial policy of banning the wearing of the Islamic headscarf by women in public, describing it as a "uniform imposed by Islamists."Macron responded: "You are going to cause a civil war if you do that. I say this sincerely." She also vowed to put an end to "anarchic and massive" immigration into France, claiming it was worsening crime which she said was becoming "unbearable" for people all over the country.AFP
