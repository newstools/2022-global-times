The figure compared with the 61.8-percent expansion in the January-February period. "There's no significant change in China's rare-earth exports, which mirrors a normal trade pattern despite geopolitical tensions," Wu Chenhui, an independent rare-earth industry analyst, told the Global Times on Wednesday. But some industry insiders estimated that the world's largest rare-earth exporter could see export drops in coming months, as China's rare-earth production capacity faces obstacles. Major border gates between China and Myanmar— which accounts for about half of China's rare-earth mineral supply - have been shut down again since the beginning of the year, posing serious challenges for the transfer of raw material supply and further price fluctuations.A manager of a state-owned rare-earth enterprise surnamed Yang based in Ganzhou, East China's Jiangxi Province, told the Global Times that the capacity of rare-earth companies in Ganzhou - one of China's biggest rare-earth manufacturing bases - has been cut by at least 25 percent compared to last year's levels. In the first two months, China exported 7,835 tons of rare earth, up 10.9 percent year-on-year.
