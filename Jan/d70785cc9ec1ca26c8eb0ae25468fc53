Illustration: VCGChina's cyberspace regulator has launched a campaign to rein in chaotic behavior in the cyberspace as Spring Festival approaches. The campaign includes curbing cyberbullying and rumormongering on the internet as well as preventing a rebound of chaotic fan club activities.The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said the one-month-long campaign will rectify a batch of accounts that engage in illegal information and chaotic scenes online to ensure people enjoy a healthy and festive Spring Festival. One of the focuses of the campaign is to reign in behaviors such as insulting or doxing others in the disguise of epidemic and trendy social topics, and online rumormongering and swindling. The campaign will also make sure the chaotic scenes of fan clubs will not rebound and that celebrities with illegal behaviors will not re-emerge.The CAC launched a two-month "Clear and Bright" campaign in May to crack down on illegal online behaviors, including chaotic phenomena relating to the entertainment sector and irrational behaviors of fan groups. Fan clubs are online groups where millions of passionate fans gather to support their idols. Some fandoms show this support by posting photos of their favored stars, but some went too far as to form small online armies that try to control comments on social media platforms.The campaign also aims to crack down on the showing off of wealth and the worshipping of money, feudal superstition and to clean up overeating live-streaming and other harmful information. The regulations will also rectify problems such as minor internet celebrities and pornography to protect the legitimate rights and interests of minors.Global Times
