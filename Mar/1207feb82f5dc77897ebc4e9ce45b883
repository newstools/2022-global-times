The South Korean government said Friday it will grant a special pardon to Park, who is serving a lengthy prison term for bribery and other crimes.

"I will provide support so that talented people can contribute to the development of my hometown of Daegu and the country."Park is the daughter of former leader Park Chung-hee and her imprisonment divided a country in which old Cold War rivalry between right and left still shapes politics. An unidentified object was thrown at Park shortly after she began delivering her remarks from a podium but she smiled and thanked the crowd. "I am extremely grateful that so many people came to warmly greet me even though I had numerous shortcomings and disappointed you." The Supreme Court in 2021 upheld Park's sentence of 20 years in prison for colluding with a friend, who was also jailed, to receive millions of dollars from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and nonprofit groups.Reuters
