The company produces krypton, xenon and neon gas for international clients.Despite the extra demand, it has reached its production ceiling and capacity expansion takes time, the person said.Ukraine is a major exporter of noble gases, of which neon accounts for 70 percent of the global supply and krypton 30 percent, according to the China Industrial Gases Industry Association. With the suspension of trade activities, including the service halt by some large shipping companies in Odessa, a major port in southern Ukraine, the market prices of noble gases have soared.For example, the price of neon gas in China's domestic market has exceeded 1,650 yuan ($261.5) per cubic meter, an increase of 65 percent from the beginning of the year, and it has quadrupled from a low in October 2021.Ma Yinchuan, head of the China Industrial Gases Industry Association, who is also the general manager of Beijing Shougang Gas Co, a large domestic gas producer, told the Global Times on Monday that there has been a conspicuous increase in inquiries this week from both old and new clients, who are asking about the prices and supplies of noble gas."There is one chipmaker that came to us today asking for an emergency purchase of tens of cubic meters of xenon, which is quite a lot to us, since our annual xenon production is 200-300 cubic meters," Ma said.While the market demand for more noble gas is understandable, Ma said that there is no need to be overly worried about market shortage."Even though noble gases from Ukraine may be disrupted now, its impact on market supplies should be manageable, since most of the domestic companies would hold at least 3-6 months of inventories," Ma said.AutoChips, a semiconductor-related company, based in Hefei, East China's Anhui Province, told the Global Times on Monday that they are in close communication with industry chain partners including TSMC over the potential impact from the changing situation in Europe. At present, the company's business has not been affected, and it will not be affected in the short and medium term, according to AutoChips."The upstream of the chip foundry has a relatively long supply chain. Even if the upstream supply of some noble gases is in short supply, it will take a certain amount of time to transmit it to the downstream," a source with AutoChips said.A recent media report said that international semiconductor-related companies including ASML are looking at diversified sources of neon gas in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.China always has a self-reliant supply of krypton, xenon and neon, but supply could be tightened as more global demand comes to China, Ma said.
