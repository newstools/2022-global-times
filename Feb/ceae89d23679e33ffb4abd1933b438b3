Despite the technological gap with the West, Chinese companies have been making major breakthroughs.Take Dongfang Jingyuan. The company has declared 145 domestic and foreign invention patents, 49 authorized invention patents, 14 software copyrights, and 15 registered trademarks since 2014.China may lag behind the West in terms of many technological areas, but it doesn’t mean that any of China’s technological progress is achieved through infringement of others’ IP rights, Xiang noted.“If ASML has the relevant patent and evidence to prove its allegations against Dongfang Jingyuan, it should take the legal weapon to defend itself, rather than starting a war of words to discredit Chinese technology companies, which simply doesn’t address any real problem,” Xiang said.
