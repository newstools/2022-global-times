Nothing can bring back my son," said Marisol Tapia, whose 12-year-old boy was among those killed."We want to prevent another tragedy like this from happening again," she added.Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, whose company built the damaged section, has promised to pay for its reconstruction.But some relatives and survivors, including Tapia, want it to be demolished and have refused to sign "reparation agreements" with the billionaire's Grupo Carso."I want it to be knocked down!" Sergio Santiago, who was injured in the accident, shouted over a loudspeaker at the commemoration."I'm adrift due to the lack of support," the 40-year-old noted, saying he had twice tried to commit suicide due to the trauma. "I have a broken thigh. I also have problems with my tibia, and I can't walk," he added.An investigation by prosecutors found that the overpass collapse was caused by errors in its construction.The metro line, the city's newest, had been plagued by problems since it was opened in 2012.An investigation by Norwegian engineering company DNV, hired by the city hall, concluded that the accident was caused by structural flaws including problems with beams and bolts.AFP
