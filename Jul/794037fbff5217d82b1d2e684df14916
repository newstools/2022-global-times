At least 978 migrants died or disappeared trying to reach Spain by sea in the first six months of 2022, an average of about five per day, a migrant rights group said Wednesday. That is less than half of the figure of 2,087 recorded during the first six months of 2021, according to Spanish non-governmental organization Caminando Fronteras which tracks data from boats in distress.The group suggests fewer people are attempting to reach Spain because ­Morocco has stepped up its clampdown on migrant crossings since Rabat and Madrid mended diplomatic ties in March.It also points out that 2021 was an especially deadly year for attempted migrant crossings to Spain, with more than 4,000 deaths or disappearances.More than 80 percent of the deaths or disappearances during the first six months of the year took place during attempts to reach Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic.The route to the Canaries is particularly dangerous due to strong currents, with trips in often overloaded boats without enough drinking water taking more than a week to reach the archipelago.Many of the departures are from distant ports in Western Sahara, Mauritania or even Senegal some 1,500 kilometers to the south.Spain has long been a key entry point for migrants seeking a better life in Europe. But the number of migrants who entered Spain by sea fell by 35.7 percent in the second quarter of 2022 over the first quarter, according to an AFP tally based on interior ministry figures.
