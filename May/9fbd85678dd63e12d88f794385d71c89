An estimated 1.2 million people lined the riverbanks to watch, despite torrential rain.The concert, in front of Buckingham Palace, was put together by Take That's Gary Barlow and featured Kylie Minogue, Robbie Williams, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Ed Sheeran, Madness and Paul McCartney.Prince Charles, in his closing speech, thanked his "mummy" for "making us proud to be British," to huge cheers.An estimated 8.5 million people took part in Big Jubilee Lunch gatherings, which replaced street parties.Elizabeth II and Philip toured Britain, while other royals visited Commonwealth countries, including Prince Harry, who raced sprint superstar Usain Bolt in Jamaica.The Houses of Parliament's clock tower was renamed the Elizabeth Tower and the Olympic Park also took on her name.The slimmed-down Buckingham Palace balcony appearance featured just Elizabeth II, Charles and his family, signaling the monarchy's future direction.AFP
