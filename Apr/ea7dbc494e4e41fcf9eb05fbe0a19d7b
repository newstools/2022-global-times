Given the severity of the situation, we cannot relax our efforts," officials from the  commission said on Tuesday. The commission recommended local residents to improve epidemic prevention and to be more cautious in dealing with goods delivered from epidemic-rampant countries and regions. The warning from the commission came after Beijing's Chaoyang district reported eight new COVID-19 cases on Monday. One of the infected individuals works at a dress store specializing in South Korean clothing at the SOHO Complex in Wangjing, an area that is home to many South Korean residents. Four other infected people are the person's colleagues and three are family members.The commission urged local departments to swiftly screen both personnel and items, to strengthen prevention and control measures such as personnel health monitoring and conducting nucleic acid testing for key groups, key industries and key areas, and to adjust and expand the testing scope according to the local epidemic situation.Global Times
