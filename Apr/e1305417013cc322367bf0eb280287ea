The first day of Iran nuclear talks, which began under the chairmanship of Enrique Mora, deputy secretary-general of the EU diplomatic service, has come to an end in the Austrian capital Vienna on November 29, 2021.

However, former US president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed Washington's unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting Iran to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the agreement in retaliation.Since April 2021, several rounds of talks have been held in the Austrian capital between Iran and the remaining JCPOA parties, namely China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, to revive the deal.Iran insists on obtaining guarantees that the succeeding US administrations would not drop the deal again and calls for the lifting of the sanctions in a verifiable manner.In 2021, newly elected President Joe Biden pledged to revive the JCPOA, blaming Trump for allowing Iran to drop its commitments to the agreement.In the past month, the negotiations - in which the US communicated with Iran indirectly through other participants and the European Union - have brought the parties close to an agreement.But the talks halted in March.Among the key sticking points is Tehran's demand that Washington remove from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideological arm of Iran's military, from the official US list of terror groups.US officials privately say that dropping the "Foreign Terrorist Organization" designation would have little real effect on the IRGC, because the group is under a long list of other sanctions that will not be lifted in any deal.But conservatives in the US Congress oppose any move to drop the designation, vowing to spoil any revived JCPOA.Agencies
