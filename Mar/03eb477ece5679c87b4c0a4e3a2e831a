Facing greater risks and challenges, conditions are becoming ripe to promote the reunification of the motherland by legal means, whether in a peaceful way or not," Zhang said.At Wednesdays press conference, when asked on the proposal, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said the office would listen and study it carefully.Reunification is the conclusion of history, the trend of the times, the cause of justice and the aspirations of the people, Zhu said. "With the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, the historic task of completing the reunification of the motherland must and will be realized."Since its implementation 17 years ago, the Anti-Secession Law has played and will continue to play a unique and important role in deterring Taiwan secessionists, maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, promoting the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and promoting the reunification of the motherland."In light of developments and changes in the situation, we will strengthen the use of the rule of law to combat secessionist forces and advance the process of national reunification," Zhu said.Global Times
