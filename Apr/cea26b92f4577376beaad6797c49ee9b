Her parents decided to prioritize the primary education of her younger siblings."I looked at my friends returning to class and felt envious," said Adella, who had hoped to become a journalist but now sells TV decoders on the streets of Kampala. "I wished my parents could afford school, but I knew they had nothing left."Reuters
