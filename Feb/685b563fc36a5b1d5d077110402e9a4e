"And at the same time, he cared about the people around him. He often asked me to confirm if I, the driver and the security staff had meals or had warm places to stay."Wu told the Global Times that the biggest challenge during her service was having to quickly react to the sudden changes in Bach's schedule. "I think it is the quick and fluent communication between different sectors and the highly effective ways of dealing with sudden changes that reflect the professional qualification of Chinese staffers. Wu said that if Beijing 2008 greatly improved the "hardware" infrastructure across China, including sports stadium and barrier-free facilities, then the Winter Games brought advocacy of advanced and new ideas or concepts such as the promotion of winter sports, carbon neutrality and a barrier-free "software" environment for the disabled. "While many things are still wishes and assumptions, they are very likely to come true or become normal in our everyday lives by 2035," Wu said.
