It requires strong network support and advanced artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT) and other technologies, Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday."In these aspects, China's 5G wireless network and gigabit broadband are at the world's advanced level, which can be said to be the best among major economies. "The development is rapid, which ensures that China has the ability to be the first to complete the digital construction, which is conducive to the realization of the metaverse," said Ma.AI and VR have witnessed rapid development in China in recent years. China ranked first in the world in terms of application and technology patents for AI, VR and IoT, said Ma.The 5G network is the base for the development of VR and IoT, and China is a leading market for 5G adoption, said Global System for Mobile Communications Alliance (GSMA).In 2021, China announced policies related to the VR industry, mainly focusing on the deep application and industrial integration of new technologies such as VR, blockchain, edge computing, big data and AI.According to an industry analysis released in June 2021, China's VR/AR terminal hardware shipments will increase to 60 million by 2025. It is estimated that the market for China's VR/AR terminal hardware in 2025 will be 179.8 billion yuan ($28.5 billion).Economic and social development is moving toward integration of the real and virtual worlds. With the expansion of connected objects and the upgrading of infrastructure, new models such as the metaverse are emerging, China Mobile Chairman Yang Jie said on Monday at MWC22, according to a press release sent from China Mobile to the Global Times.It is expected that by the end of 2022, China Mobile will have 1 million 5G base stations installed, with about 330 million 5G end users.At present, more than 1.42 million 5G base stations are installed in China, and the number will reach 2 million at the end of 2022, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said on Monday.Huawei, a major 5G gear supplier attending the MWC Barcelona, said that it will help telecom operators with digital technologies. Together with operators and partners, Huawei has signed more than 3,000 commercial contracts for 5G applications, the company told the Global Times on Tuesday."The development of the metaverse needs further breakthroughs in technology, which requires Chinese high-tech companies to strengthen the research and development of relevant technologies," said Ma.But Zhang Xiaorong, director of the Beijing-based Cutting-Edge Technology Research Institute, cautioned about the abuse of the metaverse."Some gaming companies and other companies that provide software and hardware for games are also getting involved in the metaverse with marketing gimmicks. It's just that some of the declining technology manufacturers have given themselves a new name," Zhang told the Global Times on Tuesday.Zhang said that AI companies and cloud computing vendors, which are real high-tech players, are more sober, and few claim to belong to the metaverse.
