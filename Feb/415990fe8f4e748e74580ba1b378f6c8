It wears a full-body “shell” made out of ice, which resembles an astronaut suit - a tribute to embracing new technologies for a future with infinite possibilities. The bright colors of the halo around its face are a representation of the latest advanced technologies of the ice and snow sport tracks at the Games, while the heart on its left palm symbolizes China’s hospitality for athletes and spectators at the Winter Olympics.Another mascot “Shuey Rhon Rhon” is a Chinese lantern child, whose design features elements from traditional Chinese paper cutting and Ruyi ornaments. The glow emanating from Shuey Rhon Rhon’s heart symbolizes the friendship, warmth, courage and perseverance of Para athletes.“Shuey” shares the same pronunciation of the Chinese character for snow, while the first “Rhon” in Chinese means to “to include, to tolerate,” and the second “Rhon” means “to melt, to fuse and warm.” It promotes the desire to have greater inclusion for people with impairments throughout society, and more dialogue and understanding between the cultures of the world.
