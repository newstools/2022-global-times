Illustration: Chen Xia/GTThe COVID-19 has hit the consumer market, leading to a rapid growth momentum in health expenditure. An increasing number of ordinary people are willing to pay to stay healthy, resulting in consumption on related fields such as sports and fitness, healthy furniture, and medical care witnessing a rising trend. According to the Urban Depositor Survey Report of Q2 2022, health care comes as the second item when depositors were asked on which they planned to spend more over the next three months. More young people tend to pay increasing attention to their fitness, becoming the emerging force of the health consumption market. Many of them have more interests in membership of a dance studio, fresh ingredients for a nutritious meal, or home medical devices to monitor their physical conditions. As the concept of healthy life is accepted by more people, and health products and technologies continue to make breakthroughs and innovations, the health consumption market will develop at an accelerated pace with a promising future.
