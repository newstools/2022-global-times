Asian stock markets fell further Monday after the omicron variant of the coronavirus was found in more countries and governments imposed travel controls.

She said the cumulative economic losses inflicted by the pandemic over the five years through 2024 are expected to total nearly $14 trillion, compared to the pre-pandemic forecasts.A key challenge facing the global economy is the surge in prices, especially energy and food. But even excluding those items, so-called core inflation in the US is still projected to finish 2022 around 3.4 percent, well above the Federal Reserve's two percent target, Gopinath said. Supply chain issues caused by the pandemic should begin to ease in the second half of the year, but "inflation, even though it's declining, it will be high," she said in the interview.The phenomenon is expected to bring more aggressive action by key central banks like the US Federal Reserve, which will raise borrowing costs worldwide, hindering recovery efforts, particularly in indebted developing nations.The WEO baseline assumes the Fed will hike the benchmark interest rate three times this year and three in 2023.But Gopinath cautioned that "higher inflation surprises in the US could elicit aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and sharply tightening global financial conditions."Inflation is expected to average 3.9 percent in advanced economies and 5.9 percent in emerging market and developing economies in 2022, before subsiding in 2023.
