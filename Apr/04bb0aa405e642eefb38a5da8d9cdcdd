A "Great Green Wall" should be built to protect the ecological environment.As a faithful advocate of the Paris Agreement, China pledged to decrease its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by more than 65 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.In September 2020, China announced its ambitious targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060.The Beijing guidelines on pollution prevention and control also regard the development of a green and low-carbon economy, transition to clean and low-carbon energy and efficient utilization as one of the main priorities.The proportion of renewable energy in total energy consumption will reach 14.4 percent by 2025, and the transition from coal, gas, oil consumption to electricity consumption will be gradually realized, read the guidelines.The promotion of clean energy will be carried out in key industries and areas, including the electrification of public transport and official vehicles, and the realization of clean transport in key industries such as petrochemicals and automobile manufacturing, as well as in key areas such as airports. According to the guidelines, Beijing's ecological environment is expected to improve fundamentally by 2035, along with a green way of working and living widely recognized in society, a steady decline in carbon emissions, significant progress in carbon neutrality, and the completion of building an ecological city with blue skies, clear water and forests.Global Times
