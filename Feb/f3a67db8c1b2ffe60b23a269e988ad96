Now all it requires is the signature of President Emmanuel Macron to enter into force.Thousands of paintings by some of the world's most famous artists were looted or forcibly acquired during the Nazi occupation of France.Since the end of the conflict, they have been kept in custody by public museums such as the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay in Paris.In 2018, the government set up a special unit to try to track down the heirs of the owners, rather than waiting for them to come forward, in what was a bid to speed up the process.One of the paintings set to be returned is titled Rose bushes under trees by Gustav Klimt. Currently held by the Musee d'Orsay, it is the only painting by the Austrian master owned by the French state.It was acquired in 1980, but subsequent research has shown it was forcibly sold by Austrian collector Eleonore Stiasny in Vienna in 1938 before she was deported and killed.In December 2021, another four works of looted art were returned to their Jewish owners legal heirs.The watercolors and drawings by French 19th-century artists were seized in 1940 from businessman Moise Levi de Benzion. Until these four works were returned, only 169 artworks had been restored to their owners since 1951 out of an estimated 2,200 held by the French state.The French culture ministry estimates that a total of 100,000 artworks were seized in France during World War II, when the country was administered by the Nazis and an anti-Semitic French collaborationist regime.  In November 2021, France has handed back 26 treasures which were looted from the West African nation of Benin during the colonial era, part of a separate pledge by Macron to restore some artworks to the African continent.AFP
