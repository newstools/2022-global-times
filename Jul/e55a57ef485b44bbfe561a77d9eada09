They are advised to open the packages outside their home and they have to wear masks and disposable gloves when opening the packages or fully disinfect the exterior of the packages and clean their hands after opening.The recent imported COVID-19 case discovered in Shunyi district and the local case in Chaoyang were detected early enough and put under control while at the same time the infection sources were been identifying, said Xu Hejian, spokesperson of the Beijing municipal government.After the detection of one local positive case through regular COVID-19 testing on Friday, no new cases have since been reported in Beijing as of Saturday.
