Experts stressed that such cases are unlikely to cascade into large-scale systemic risks for China's banking system, whose risk management mechanisms are generally deemed strong enough to withstand the risk. Since 2019, there have been some defaults in the real estate market, which has given enough time for the regulators and financial institutions to manage the risks. The government-led market-oriented restructuring of defaulted real estate companies will not cause market panic or the spread of risks, ANBOUND, a multinational independent think tank, said in a research note it sent to the Global Times. While the think tank called for more "precise" guidance and management of problematic property firms, addressing the problem faced by some defaulted developers in a timely manner is likely to revitalize the housing market of the world's second-largest economy quickly, experts said.Global Times
