Local police have imposed a curfew in the Western Province, including the capital Colombo, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The situation has sparked global concerns about the future of the country's 22 million people, with some struggling to buy basic goods and fuel.Among many other types of humanitarian aid, China has been talking about restructuring plans with Sri Lanka, and an important issue is to rearrange the debt payments as they fall due, Zhou Rong, a senior researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday."The most important thing is for all stakeholders, including international organizations and countries, to negotiate debt restructuring plans, and revise and postpone payment dates, in an effort to solve the most urgent problem for the country," Zhou said. "But everyone needs to realize that it cannot pay back loans, at least for the moment, since it is running out of foreign exchange and needs time to recover."According to the External Resources Department of Sri Lanka, in 2019, by far the largest proportion of debt, almost 50 percent, was owed to international sovereign bond holders, mainly US-based funds and banks. Japan and China each held 10 percent and India held 2 percent of Sri Lankan debt. The remaining part was owed to others, including multilateral banks such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.Analysts pointed out that China's loans to the country are mainly long-term ones with a range of 15-20 years and preferential rates. Moreover, industry watchers pointed out that Sri Lanka should better ensure the operation of key projects such as the China-operated ports, which not only support the movement of international trade, but can also inject economic momentum and play a key role in helping the country attract foreign investment at a later time.

Container throughput of China Merchants Port Holdings Co-managed Colombo International Container Terminal increased by 5.2 percent year-on-year, and the port's bulk and general cargo throughput increased by 1.5 percent year-on-year, according to the firm."What we need to point out is that Sri Lanka is a country under the rule of law, and protecting the interests of foreign investors is also the country's consistent proposition. It should be able to safeguard the investment interests of China Merchants Port in Sri Lanka. We will also review developments from time to time and take necessary measures to mitigate risks when necessary," said the company.
