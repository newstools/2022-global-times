Now is the time to heal, to recover and to rebuild," he said in a televised address to the nation.South Africa's already struggling economy was worsened by the pandemic, with unemployment rate rising to a record 35.3 percent during the last three months of 2021."Although the pandemic is not over, and although we continue to remain cautious, we can be confident that we are in a better position now than we have been at any other time over the last 750 days," said Ramaphosa.However, some "transitional" measures such as mask-wearing in indoor spaces will remain in place for the next 30 days.South Africa is the continent's most infected, counting more than 3.7 million coronavirus cases or more than 30 percent of Africa's over 11.3 million cases.So far 100,052 COVID-19-related deaths have been recorded, but researchers say the actual fatalities could be triple the reported figures.AFP
