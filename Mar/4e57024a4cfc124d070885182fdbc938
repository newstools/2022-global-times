Standing on the podium together and wearing a silver medal each , this is a shared glory for the two people! "When I heard our national anthem playing on the podium, I was very excited. Thanks to my coaching staff, I see my value," Zhu told the Xinhua News Agency.According to Zhu, her wins over the weekend made up for the regret she felt for missing out on the Paralympic Games in 2008.Before the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing, doctors told Zhu that she risked losing her remaining vision unless she underwent surgery immediately. At her coach's suggestion, Zhu chose to accept the surgery, thus sacrificing her chance to shine at the Games."Facing difficulties is easier than dealing with regret - I think I can overcome any difficulties now," Zhu said.
