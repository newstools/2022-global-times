A lower court judge earlier this year refused the US request for extradition.

It is squarely in the political domain."The ruling Wednesday by a magistrate in central London brings the long-running legal saga in the UK courts closer to a conclusion.But Assange's lawyers have until May 18 to make representations to Patel and could potentially launch further appeals on other points in the case.The case has become a cause celebre for media freedom, with Julian Assange's supporters accusing Washington of trying to muzzle reporting of legitimate security concerns.Washington wants to put him on trial in connection with the publication of 500,000 secret military files relating to the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Stella Assange said the grounds to appeal against extradition in the United Kingdom are very narrow, with the treaty "heavily tilted in favor of the United States."The matters being raised "go to the heart of what it means to have a free and open society of having a free press," she said, and raised the possibility of taking the matter to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.AFP
