"We believe all of Iran's safeguarding issues will be solved by then."Talks in Vienna over restoring the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), have stalled in recent months, for this the Iran Foreign Ministry holds the US responsible.China and Russia voted against the text while three countries – India, Libya and Pakistan – abstained, according to Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov.“Countries which represent more than 1/2 of mankind didn’t support the resolution,” he wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. Global Times
