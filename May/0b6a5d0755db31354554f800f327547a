Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that he doesn't expect that the West will decide to unblock the Black Sea by force, the Ukrinform news agency reported Wednesday."The North Atlantic Treaty Organization did not close the skies over Ukraine at the most tragic moments of the war, then why would they open the Black Sea so that agricultural products can be exported from Ukraine without hindrance," Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Efforts on resolving the issue of the Black Sea ports blockade were underway in Ukraine, Kuleba said.Last week, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc will establish a series of "green corridors" for Ukrainian grain exports.
