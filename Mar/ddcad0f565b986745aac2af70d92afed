Secondly, market constraints should also be strengthened to help the star-making frenzy return to rationality,” the advisor said, according to China News Service.Some Chinese netizens supported the suggestion about a classifying system. “It is very difficult not to support it. A rating system is really necessary for industries such as film and television,” a Sina Weibo user commented.Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing, thought that most minors lack a sense of personal protection and the capability to tell right from wrong. Short videos have considerable influence on young people at present, and many videos on the platforms such as Kuaishou focus on drawing attention but neglect quality, so the rating system is urgently needed, Xiong added.Chinese authorities have set about rectifying the idol reality shows and fan circles. China's National Radio and Television Administration issued a notice in September 2021 to control idol training shows – competitive reality shows that pit potential stars against each other, with the winners going on to become China's newest idols – by prohibiting TV and streaming platforms from airing them. The ban came after a series of incidents, including fans wasting tons of milk to vote for their idols in the hit show Youth With You Season 3.
