This comes after the man had lived in seclusion for six years in Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon.The man, surnamed Lin, was first noticed by the police for his strange behavior as he wandered around a small town in the city of Nyingchi in Xizang. Lin told the police that he had started a self-sufficient life at the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon since 2015 after cycling and hiking for years across China. Lin said he used to leave the canyon once or twice a year since he had learned how to make a living in the woods - cutting down trees for cabin building, heating and cooking, reclaiming the land to grow crops.Given that Lin's acts of cutting trees and starting a fire may endanger the environment and himself, the police took him back home and contacted his family members. Global Times
