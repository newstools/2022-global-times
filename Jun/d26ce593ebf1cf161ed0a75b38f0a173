According to the bill, parliament would dissolve, with new elections to be held on October 25 or November 1, with the date to be set after further negotiations.The bill must then be approved in two further full Knesset votes.Some opposition lawmakers said there was a still a chance to stave off another general election and restore Netanyahu to office by recruiting right-wingers from the outgoing coalition. "We can still prevent elections by midnight Wednesday," Bezalel Smotrich of the far-right Religious Zionism party said in parliament. "But if they're forced upon us, they will be the dawn of a new day."AFP
