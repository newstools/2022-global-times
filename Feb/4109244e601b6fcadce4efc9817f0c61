Poster of Indian film Kanaa Photo: WeiboIndian box-office hit, Kanaa, will be released in China on March 18, another movie that exposes India's social issues on gender and race.The film featuring actress Aishwarya Rajesh mainly tells a story of an Indian girl born in a very poor family who later breaks through prejudice and obstacles and achieves incredible things on her own.The movie is also the second Tamil film to be released in China, after the Kollywood film, 2.0, in 2019. Released in 2018 in India, the movie has a score of 7.8 out of 10 on IMDb online database, although it was described by the Hindustan Times as a "forced and predictable" plot.The movie tells the inspirational and passionate story of a farmer's daughter who decided to play her father's favorite sport, cricket. She finally succeeded by breaking the chains of gender inequality and racial discrimination, with her father playing a supportive role to achieve her goal. As a girl coming from the bottom, she suffered hostility on her way up and won respect by fighting back bravely. The Indian movie Dangal unexpectedly became a phenomenon on the Chinese big screen with a box office revenue of over 760 million yuan ($120 million), breaking the record in China for foreign films not made by Hollywood.With a similar background, the same sports theme and the father-daughter love it conveys, the movie is in many aspects similar to the phenomenal film Dangal. However, it remains uncertain whether Kanaa can be as big in China.
