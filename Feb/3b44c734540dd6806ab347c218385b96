Fatima Martins, another party member, gave a similar account.However, the identity of the assailants is unclear. AFP was unable to reach the defense ministry for comment.The raid comes after a failed coup attempt on February 1 in Guinea-Bissau, a notoriously unstable nation of around 2 million people.That day, heavily armed men attacked government buildings in Bissau while the president was chairing a cabinet meeting. Eleven people were killed in the attack.Embalo later said he had escaped the five-hour gun battle and described the attack as a plot to wipe out the government.He has named a former head of the navy, as well as two other men, as being behind the coup attempt.On Tuesday, ex-prime minister and PAIGC leader Domingos Simoes Pereira was also banned from leaving the country in connection with an investigation into an alleged 2021 putsch attempt.AFP
