Photo: VCGDisney's CEO Bob Chapek has been under fire on Chinese social media after he said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday that Disney's movies will do fine without box office from the Chinese market.Chapek noted that Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness, which is not scheduled for Chinese distribution, had just crossed the $500 million mark box office in less than a week."We're pretty confident that even without China, if it were to be that we continue to have difficulties in getting titles in there, that it doesn't really preclude our success given the relatively lower take rate that we get on the box office in China than we do across the rest of the world," Chapek said.Chapek's comment has met with criticism in China as netizens believed that Disney is being arrogant and looking down on the Chinese market after making huge profit here."Why didn't you say so when you were making money in China," wrote a user of Chinese social media Sina Weibo."If they had said so I shall grant their wish by not watching Disney films any longer. Let's wait and see who is the final loser," said another netizen on Weibo.China has been one of Walt Disney's most significant sources of revenue for its films and themed parks with a large fanbase out 1.4 billion population.For example, the Avengers: Endgame released in 2019 has made $629.1 million at Chinese box office according to IMDb data, accounting for more than 22 percent of its box office worldwide.Shanghai Disneyland as the first to emerge from the epidemic outbreak in 2020 among all its themed parks, also saw rising revisit numbers, boosted by recovering tourism.After Shanghai Disneyland reopened in May 2020, the data point toward a healthy and improving business condition the resort had in recent years. For example, it showed that the number of visitors who watched Shanghai Disneyland's theme parade had risen by 20 percent from 2018 to 2021; it also showed that the tourists who revisited the resort had risen by about 50 percent from 2017 to 2019.
