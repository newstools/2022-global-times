It also reported a fire at the Abu Dhabi International Airport.The UAE said it reserved rights to respond to the Houthi threat.The attacks were widely condemned by Arab and foreign countries.This attack came nearly one week after the Houthis hijacked and captured a UAE-flagged commercial ship off the Houthi-held Red Sea city of Hodeidah.The UN Security Council has called on the Houthi group to release the ship and crew members. The call was rejected by the Houthi group.The UAE is part of a Saudi-led Arab coalition supporting the Yemeni internationally recognized government against the Houthi militia.Last week, the coalition-backed Yemeni government army recaptured four strategic districts in the oil-rich provinces of Shabwa and Marib from the militia.Yemen has been mired in a civil war since late 2014 when the Houthi militia seized control of several northern provinces and forced the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi out of the capital Sanaa.
