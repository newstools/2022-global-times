Photo: VCGIsrael's domestic spying scandal widened Monday, with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett vowing government action following new reports that police illegally used the Pegasus malware to hack phones of dozens of prominent figures.The latest bombshell from business daily Calcalist alleged that Pegasus was used against a son of former premier Benjamin Netanyahu and his advisors, as well as activists, senior government officials, businessmen and others.Calcalist had previously reported that the controversial malware, which can turn a phone into a pocket spying device, was used by police against leaders of an anti-Netanyahu protest movement.After Monday's report emerged, Bennett vowed that his government "won't leave this without a response.""The reports apparently describe a very grave situation that is unacceptable in a democracy," Bennett said. "These cyber tools were designed to fight terrorism and serious crime, not be used against citizens. We will see to a transparent, in-depth and quick inquiry."As Bennett pledged action, Minister for Public Security Omer Barlev, who oversees the police, said he would seek authorization for a government commission of inquiry.The police told AFP that Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai requested an "external and independent investigation committee" and that police would "cooperate fully and transparently."Pegasus, a malware product made by the Israeli firm NSO Group, is at the center of a months-long international scandal following revelations that it was used by governments worldwide to spy on activists, politicians, journalists and even heads of state.Israel had already come under fire for allowing the export of the invasive technology to states with poor human rights records.AFP
