This can reduce quarantine requirements for drivers in cross-province transport," Zhang said.An auto parts supplier based in Nantong, East China's Jiangsu Province, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the move could be an effective solution to the logistics woes.The company has seen a drop of 50 percent in orders from its customers in Shanghai in recent weeks, the person said, adding that now even with orders coming in as Shanghai gradually resumes factory operation, no truck drivers are willing to carry cross-city goods due to worries of being unable to "come back.""As long as truck drivers do not need to go into Shanghai, and hopefully the transfer station will not be too far from our factory site, the solution can work," said the person.The Yangtze River Delta region, which includes East China's Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces and Shanghai, is an important base for China's vehicle and semiconductor industries, accounting for over 20 percent of domestic auto output and nearly half that of the semiconductor industry.Shanghai on Saturday announced its own "whitelist" of 666 leading manufacturers in the city to restart factory operations. This included over 200 auto parts companies, making up about one-third of the "whitelist," and nearly 70 integrated circuit industry companies. Suzhou in Jiangsu may also create a "whitelist" that covers 393 key enterprises, mainly in the electronics industry, according to media reports. However, many industry insiders are still feeling the pain of insufficient and more costly logistics services."It will inevitably take longer and cost more with mechanisms like transfer stations," Zhang said.A Shanghai-based vehicle control system supplier also expressed concern. "Whether the delivery will be ensured and completed in a timely manner remains a question. Therefore, small suppliers are still halting deliveries for the security of the goods," a person from the company told the Global Times on condition of anonymity. "We still haven't resumed operation and orders are delayed," he said.At a teleconference on improving logistics flows and industry supply chains on Monday, Vice Premier Liu He stressed the need to stabilize China's supply chains and solve outstanding problems one by one in key regions.Authorities have stressed that efforts must be taken to ensure that traffic permits for drivers are recognized across the country and transport should not be limited.
