Illustration: Chen Xia/GTRecently, an 86-year-old man surnamed Sun in East China's Zhejiang Province successfully obtained a driving license after meeting all the requirements needed, in order to take his mobility-impaired wife to the doctor. Everyone admires the man's perseverance at his age, but his experience as a researcher of the "Two Bombs and One Satellite" is more well known. Sun said that at first, he was rejected by three driving schools, and then the head of one school decided to let him try. "Many young coaches are afraid to teach Sun. But in my opinion, his hands-on ability is quite strong, I would like to challenge myself so I agreed to teach him," Sun's coach said. In October 2020, the Ministry of Public Security relaxed the age requirement for a small car driver's license by removing the upper age limit of 70 years old. As life expectancy increases and quality of life improves in China, it is believed that more and more elderly people will get their driving licenses in the future.
