People sit by a fountain in a park in Madrid, Spain on Saturday. Residents in Spain are trying to stay as cool as possible as forecasts showed weekend temperatures could rise above 40 C in large parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The heat is expected to scorch central south Spain on Saturday before spreading east over the next two days.
