Should a reunification-by-force operation take place, the two ships can either be deployed from the south and the north to the east side of the island of Taiwan, or they can form a dual amphibious assault ship group, concentrating their forces for a landing mission, the expert said.The dual amphibious assault ship group is now a new instrument at the PLA Navy's disposal for key amphibious landing missions, the expert said.A third Type 075 is reportedly undergoing sea trials, and is expected to enter service soon.
