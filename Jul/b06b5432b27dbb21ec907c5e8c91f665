Photo: CCTVThe Red Building, once a main campus of Peking University and a key location in the history of the Communist Party of China (CPC), opened an educational base on Monday for students to practice ideological and political classes. The educational base, established at the Red Building, will open for the next generations to learn Party's and national histories. Students in universities, primary and secondary schools in Beijing will study ideological and political courses, and teachers will practice ideological and political courses there.It is essential to gradually open and upgrade ideological and political theory courses in primary, secondary and tertiary schools, which is an important guarantee for training future generations who are well-prepared to join the socialist cause, Chinese leaders had said. Teachers were also told to improve the ideological and theoretical level of the courses and make the courses closer to students and more focused. The ideological and political courses should deliver the country's mainstream ideology and directly respond to false ideas and thoughts, the Xinhua News Agency reports said. The establishment of the educational base will better utilize historical resources to help students and teachers learn about ideological and political knowledge, lift a healthy atmosphere in which the whole Party and society strive to do good in ideological and political courses, and guide students to grow up to shoulder the responsibilities of national rejuvenation, officials said. Built from 1916 to 1918, the building was named after its red brick walls and tiled roof. It has witnessed several major historical events in China's modern history, including the New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement, both of which greatly contributed to the early spread of Marxism in the country and the founding of the CPC, Xinhua reported.Global Times
