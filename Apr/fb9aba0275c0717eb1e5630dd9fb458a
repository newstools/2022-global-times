So far, we've also used the 'Silk Road' via Belarus and Russia to China," read the BMW statement.But the statement does not clarify whether the "Silk Road" refers to the rail route and what kinds of products were shipped that way.Bremerhaven is a port city in northern Germany. BMW's European plants are less than 10 hours by road from Bremerhaven.Immediately after the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Audi proactively suspended rail transport to and from China via Russia with the Trans-Siberian Railway, according to a statement from VW Group sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.Audi also said its vehicle and material shipments have been handled both by sea freight and by truck via the so-called southern route via Romania."We are currently examining whether transport by rail via the southern route will also be possible in the near future," read the statement.In 2021, BMW Group delivered 2.521 million vehicles globally.
