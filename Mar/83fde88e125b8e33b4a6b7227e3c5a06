So the researchers used Sea Hero Quest, which was created in 2016 to study Alzheimer's disease and has since been played by nearly 4 million people.Coutrot said people who grew up in rural areas scored better because "the countryside is a rather complex environment in that it is very unorganized, with greater distances, meaning you have to memorize your route."However, people raised in more complex cities such as Paris and Prague did much better than those from cities with orderly grid-based street plans like Chicago, he added.And adults can still improve their sense of direction later in life if they work at it. "It's a bit like learning another language, which will be much easier if you learned it when you were young," Coutrot said.AFP
