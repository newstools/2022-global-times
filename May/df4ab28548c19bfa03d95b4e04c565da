Experts noted that vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of severe illness and death among seniors but they have concerns over the side-effects of the vaccines as many seniors have underlying diseases and some believed that the pandemic has gradually improved and do not need to be vaccinated.Insurance products were also launched for employees of small and micro companies in Beijing that had to shut down due to anti-epidemic measures to guarantee they have a basic support, media said.
