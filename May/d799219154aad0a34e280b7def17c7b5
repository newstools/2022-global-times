After graduation, she won a scholarship to study in Japan - her first time in her parents' home country - and stayed to build a career in finance.Her "womenomics" argument struck a chord with ministers because it offered a new perspective on the benefits of equality, she believes. As well as targets and requirements for large companies to disclose data on gender balance, Matsui has also seen a shift in how the issue is viewed in Japan, from a niche issue to a "daily topic of conversation."But she remains committed to her original principles of crunching data and finding solutions, rather than just talking about the problems faced by women in the workforce."You cannot manage what you don't measure," she said.Now, as co-director of the venture capital company MPower Partners, which invests in businesses that prioritize environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG), Matsui wants to grow Japan's relatively small startup scene."Part of why it's so small is because there's not enough diversity, or because [the companies] don't think globally enough. Those are two angles where we at MPower really want to help change," she said.But firms seeking investment should beware of resorting to superficial tactics like so-called greenwashing: "We're not so interested in companies just trying to tick the box."AFP
