They were charged with crime against the honor of heroes and martyrs. At a press briefing on Monday, the Supreme People's Procuratorate explained the reasons why the crime was applicable in this case, even though the late academician was not a "hero or martyr" as is defined in the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs. According to Luo Qingdong, a prosecutor from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the definition of "heroes and martyrs" in the charge of crimes against the honor of heroes and martyrs refers to the heroes and martyrs who have sacrificed their lives or passed away. As to those deceased hero models who made tremendous contributions and sacrifices for our country, nation and people, and whose deeds and spirits are generally recognized by the community, such as Yuan Longping, their reputation and honor carry socialist core values, and should be protected by the law.
