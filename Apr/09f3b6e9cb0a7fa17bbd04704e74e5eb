Every hour we are seeing people continue to flee Ukraine," she told reporters in Geneva."This displacement has been on such an expansive scale, and the rapidity of this we haven't seen in recent times." After just two months of war, the Ukraine conflict appears set to soon produce more refugees than Syria, which after 11 years of civil conflict saw 6.8 million of its nationals register as refugees.The demographics of Ukraine's refugee population also differ from many other crises.Women and children account for 90 percent of those who have fled abroad, with men aged 18 to 60 eligible for military call-up unable to leave.The UNHCR said that neighboring host countries had the capacity to respond to the crisis, but that "the scale of refugee arrivals and the breadth of their needs requires further support for national social protection systems and services."Nearly six out of 10 Ukrainian refugees - more than 2.9 million - have fled to Poland. While the rapidly rising refugee numbers are staggering, they do not paint the full picture.Around 7.7 million people have been displaced from their homes but remain inside Ukraine, meaning that 12.7 million total have been uprooted since the crisis began."Almost 13 million more people are also estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to security risks," Mantoo said. The UN humanitarian agency OCHA estimated Tuesday that 15.7 million people in Ukraine are in need of humanitarian aid, up from its previous estimate of 12 million.Before the conflict, Ukraine had a population of 37 million in the regions under government control.AFP
