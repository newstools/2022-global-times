He highlighted how the National Palace of Culture, an iconic structure at Revolution Square in Nicaragua's capital Managua, was recently lit red in honor of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and the Chinese New Year. Revolution Square was where the recently reelected Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega held the inauguration ceremony, highlighting its important political significance.Yu said this year marks the first Chinese New Year after the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Nicaragua, bringing many people cause for celebration locally, especially during the Winter Olympic Games.He said there are two large advertisement screens in the center of Managua. Since the eight-day countdown to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, they have been broadcasting clips about the Games and programs about the "Year of the Tiger," which have attracted many local people to stop and watch."The Chinese Embassy also organized a special friendly baseball game with the Nicaraguan government team dubbed the 'Nicaraguan Warriors versus the Chinese Tigers', to highlight sports cooperation between the two countries amid resumed ties and the ongoing Winter Olympic Games, he noted.

"But at that time, Nicaragua was in the middle of Christmas and New Year holidays so few people were going to work. Finally, the Nicaraguan authorities helped us contact various artisans and found someone to work overtime to make the plaque for us in short order," he recalled."Another example is one of our colleagues came from a neighboring country to Nicaragua to support reopening of the embassy and had to travel on a weathered road by oxen and carriages. The Nicaraguan side specifically sent military staff to escort the colleague to ensure that our colleague arrived safely in Managua," he said.It is fair to say that the Nicaraguan side has provided us with support within its capacity in all aspects of our restoration work, and our comparatively small team could not have achieved as much progress in as little time without the warm and friendly support of local authorities," said Yu.Yu welcomes early reopening of the Nicaraguan Embassy in China, adding that he and his colleagues back in China would provide the utmost assistance in return.Since the restoration of diplomatic ties, China and Nicaragua have been united and engaged in active cooperation against COVID-19. China has provided 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and 1 million syringes to Nicaragua, Yu revealed. "As I recall, China and Nicaragua resumed diplomatic ties on December 10, 2021. By December 12, we had already provided the first batch of 200,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Nicaragua.""At that time, Nicaragua's minister of health and the director of the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute came in person to receive the consignment of vaccines. They were moved and said that in their eyes, 'Chinese vaccines are the best vaccines in the world.'"The Chinese diplomat said this mutual support shows China's firm determination to stand with developing countries including Nicaragua, displays the friendship of the Chinese with Nicaraguan people, and makes a good start for bilateral cooperation. China will also continue to support Nicaragua's anti-epidemic efforts and strive to build a community of health for mankind.The Nicaraguan government reported on Tuesday that a group of 30 students were sent to China for their studies "in various branches." The students landed in China's Hong Kong before heading to the two cities where they will undertake their studies: Beijing and Wuhan.Yu confirmed this news to the Global Times. He said the Nicaraguan students in China will mainly study engineering, science and technology, and language, because they are eager to learn from China's strong ability to develop science and technology independently.Some of the students said they were very excited about the opportunity to study in China, and are sincerely grateful for China's friendly arrangement and full of expectations for their studies and life in China, said Yu.Yu said that China has also offered scholarships to these Nicaraguan students in the hopes that they will gain a practical and deep understanding of China and become a bridge for China-Nicaragua cooperation in the future.Timeline of resumed ties
