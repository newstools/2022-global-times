For example, AI is widely used in poverty alleviation, the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic and achieving the country's 'double carbon' goal," Liu Gang, director of the Nankai Institute of Economics and chief economist at the Chinese Institute of New Generation AI Development Strategies, said during the congress.This mission-oriented development has injected new vitality into the AI industry development and the deep integration with the real economy, Liu added.In recent years, the development of AI in China has been widely and enthusiastically accepted by the public, Liu said. In the field of smart networked vehicles, a survey by the institute showed that 85 percent of those who have test-driven self-driving cars believed that most self-driving technologies have surpassed or even expected to surpass the driving levels of most drivers. More respondents stated that they trust platform companies, including Baidu and Huawei who are now providing autonomous driving technology and products.  Moreover, 90 percent of respondents expect the country to speed up the introduction of laws and regulations covering autonomous driving."Driven by 'deep' technological innovation, China is becoming a global tech power at an accelerating pace, while gradually developing into an economic power," Liu said.Global Times
