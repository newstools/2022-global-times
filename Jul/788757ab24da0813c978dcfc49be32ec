As of press time, the company, which plans to issue the revenue report of the second quarter next Thursday, has not responded to the latest action of the US SEC when it was approached by the Global Times.The threat of the US SEC will have a short-term impact on the stock price of Alibaba and other companies, but it is the growth of these companies' earnings and China's rising status in the global economic landscape that will determine the long-term stock prices of these companies, Mei said.Alibaba said on Tuesday that it will upgrade its secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) to a primary one under a new exchange procedure that allows dual primary listings.  While the US' continuous push for financial decoupling from China will admittedly have an impact on Chinese companies, as Chinese companies have found other listing options, forcing them to leave the US market can only hurt the attractiveness of the US market to international capital, experts said.China will continue to actively support the overseas listing of eligible companies, the China Securities Regulatory Commission reiterated at the 2022 mid-year system supervision work conference held on Friday.Global Times
