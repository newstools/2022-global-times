Photo: cnsphoto"Their hysteria will only make people around the world see more clearly their arrogance, hegemony-oriented thinking, their hypocrisy and double standards," said the spokesman of the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), who condemned the heads of government of a few countries for smearing the central government's policies in Hong Kong on Saturday.While China was celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, heads of government of a few countries disregarded facts and played the same old tune again to smear the central government's policies towards Hong Kong, the practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and the effects of the National Security Law for the HKSAR, said the spokesman.On Thursday, the US Department of State issued a statement pointing out the anti-extradition bill protest in 2019 in Hong Kong and saying that the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return "was envisioned as the halfway point of 50 years of promised autonomy under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework. Yet it is now evident that Hong Kong and Beijing authorities "no longer view democratic participation, fundamental freedoms and an independent media as part of this vision." The statement was then supported and hyped by the Secretary of State of the US, foreign ministers of the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a few EU officials, as well as some subordinate agencies of the US White House and US Congress for their own political purposes.https://www.state.gov/hong-kong-25-years-after-handover/The spokesperson firmly rejected and condemned their gross interference into China's internal affairs, as it blatantly tramples on the basic norms of international relations.Over the past 25 years, the practice of the "one country, two systems" principle has achieved success in Hong Kong and has been recognized by all, the spokesperson pointed out."As an international metropolis, Hong Kong enjoys vitality that is the admiration of the world. Facts have proved that "one country, two systems" is not only the best solution to the historical question of Hong Kong, but also the best institutional arrangement for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. There is no reason to change such a good system, and it must be adhered to over the long run," said the spokesman.The spokesperson said that since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has embraced true democracy and Hong Kong compatriots have become masters of their own destiny.Faced with political the chaos in Hong Kong of a few years ago, the central government took the decisive action to adopt the National Security Law for the HKSAR, to improve Hong Kong's electoral system and to implement the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong." These measures addressed both the symptoms and root causes of the chaos and brought Hong Kong's development back on the right track, the spokesperson said. "Hong Kong has since taken on a new look and can look forward to bright future prospects."The spokesperson pointed out that a few countries and politicians act like clowns and are obsessed with smearing Hong Kong whenever major events are held in the HKSAR. Their tricks are by no means for the good of Hong Kong, but to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China by using Hong Kong as a card. Lies cannot hide the truth.The spokesperson stressed that those who go against the historical trend have no future. "Any attempt to play the "Hong Kong card" to contain China's development is a pipe dream and is doomed to failure."The spokesperson stated that standing at a new starting point, Chinese people have high expectations for the governance team of the new SAR government."The new team will help Hong Kong seize opportunities from the country's 14th Five-Year Plan and other major development strategies, achieve greater progress by integrating into the country's overall development, write a new chapter of "one country, two systems' and make more contributions to realizing the country's second centenary goal: the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," the spokesperson said.Global Times
