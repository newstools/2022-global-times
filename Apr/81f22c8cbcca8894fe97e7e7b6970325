Illustration: Liu Rui/GTUS' blatant threat to the security cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands once again exposed the hegemony mindset and bullying behavior of someone in the US, said Chinese Embassy in the Solomon Islands on Sunday.The comment came after the remarks of some US senior officials who visited the Pacific island state on Friday, warning that the US will have significant concerns and respond accordingly to any steps to establish a permanent Chinese military presence in the Solomon Islands.Both China and the Solomon Islands have reaffirmed on many occasions that the so-called establishment of Chinese military bases is fake news made up by someone with ulterior motives as the security cooperation fits within international laws and practices on basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs, said the Chinese embassy.The spokesperson of the Chinese embassy pointed out that any attempt to stir up trouble, tension and opposition in Pacific island countries doesn't conform the common interest of regional states and won't work."Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and the Solomon Islands have achieved a fruitful cooperation in many sectors which are warmly welcomed by their people," the spokesperson added.
