Xi signed an order to release revised regulations on military equipment in January last year, new regulations on military equipment procurement in November last year, then in February this year regulations on the testing and assessment of military equipment.During a military conference on weaponry and equipment-related work in October 2021 in Beijing, Xi urged efforts to break new ground in the development of the country's military weaponry and equipment, and contribute to the realization of the goals set for the centennial of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 2027.China aims to basically complete the modernization of national defense and armed forces by 2035 and fully transform the PLA into a world-class military by the mid-21st century, Xinhua reported.The modernization of military equipment is a vital piece to realize this roadmap, analysts said.China needs an enhanced, complete process to manage the modernization of military equipment, Song said, noting that this starts from research and development, goes throughout testing, and to the equipment's eventual commissioning and deployment in the PLA.
