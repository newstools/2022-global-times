Firefighters try to extinguish a fire that broke out at a container storage facility in Sitakunda, about 40 kilometers from the key port of Chittagong, Bangladesh on June 5, 2022. Photo: AFPBangladesh authorities accused a container depot operator Monday of not telling firefighters about a chemical stockpile before it exploded with devastating consequences, killing at least 49 people - nine of them from the fire service.The toll from the giant blast, which followed a fire at the B.M Container Depot in Sitakunda and sent fireballs into the sky, was expected to rise further.Some containers were still smouldering on Monday, more than 36 hours after the explosion, preventing rescuers from checking the area around them for victims.Around a dozen of the 300 injured were in critical condition. The nine dead firefighters are the worst toll ever for the fire department in the industrial-accident-prone country, where safety standards are lax and corruption often enables them to be ignored."The depot authority did not inform us that there were deadly chemicals there. Nine of our officers were killed. Two fighters are still missing. Several people are also missing," fire department official Mohammad Kamruzzaman told AFP.Purnachandra Mutsuddi, who led the fire-fighting effort at the 26-acre (10.5-hectare) facility on Saturday night, said it  "didn't have any fire safety plan" and lacked firefighting equipment to douse the blaze before it turned into an inferno. "The safety plan lays out how the depot will fight and control a fire. But there was nothing," Mutsuddi, an assistant director of the Chittagong fire station, told AFP. "They also did not inform us about the chemicals. If they did, the casualties would have been much less," he said.AFP
