Just to get into Berlin is a huge achievement. To have won the grand prix in our section was kind of a dream come true," the film's director Colm Bairead told AFP."After the two years that we've had, it just feels like a total privilege to be able to present our film to a full home audience," he added. "Despite immense challenges, the producers, directors, writers, cast and crew continued creating world-class stories," Desiree Finnegan, Screen Ireland's chief executive, said in a statement. AFP
