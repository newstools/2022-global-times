The total investment in the project has exceeded $20 billion, while the phase one project will have a daily capacity of 180,000 barrels of crude oil per day after putting into production.Subsalt ultra-deepwater oil fields are an emerging field in the global oil industry and an important trend for future development, accounting for one-third of the world's oil reserves, according to CNOOC. The company currently holds a 9.65 percent of interest in the Mero oil field, and acquired a stake in the Búzios field in Brazil in 2021, the world's largest deepwater oil field. CNOOC currently owns five deepwater oil and gas block assets in Brazil.Global Times
