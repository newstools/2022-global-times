The final assembly work of the last two units of the station is nearing completion, and the project is moving toward full production.After the station is fully in operation, the number of hydropower units put into operation by Three Gorges in the main artery of the Yangtze River will reach 110, with total installed capacity reaching 71.695 million kilowatts.That will be equivalent to three Three Gorges Hydroelectric Power Stations, which is expected to greatly ease energy curbs across the eastern parts of the country, especially the Yangtze River Delta, an important domestic production hub.The Baihetan Hydropower Station is also helping propel China toward a green and low-carbon goal, as the country is reducing the use of coal and looking for renewable and clean energy sources.The 10 billion kWh of electricity generated by the station can replace about 3.06 million tons of standard coal and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 8.38 million tons, which is equivalent to planting 33,000 hectares of forest.In 2021, hydropower accounted for 14.6 percent of China's total power generation. The figure could reach around 17 percent this year, according to Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University.Global Times
