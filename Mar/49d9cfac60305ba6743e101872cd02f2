Before the closure of the border I used to trade with some Ivorians," Joseph Mintah, a father of four from Elubo, a border town in western Ghana, told AFP."Now I have no option than come to Accra to look for job. I'll be returning after this."Beatrice Konadu said her business selling cosmetics and customized slippers over the border in Togo and Burkina Faso had also collapsed."It has been tough for me," she told AFP by telephone from Aflao on the border with Togo."The president's announcement comes as a great news, but it has been long overdue," she said.AFP
