This geopolitical event could be a trigger to push those who have not yet looked into it much more because we have to reduce dependencies," Imbach said.Lubomila Jordanova - a climate advocate and the co-founder and CEO of Berlin-based green tech startup Plan A, an end-to-end platform that enables companies to measure, monitor and reduce their environmental footprint and improve their Environmental Social Governance - said: "I am hopeful that the events of the last three years including COVID-19 are going to allow us to see a future which is a lot more reliant on stable supply chains and on the sustainable model.""There's no other way than the renewable energy one, the sustainable one. That means that we need to shift swiftly," she added.Jordanova emphasized that the momentum for the company's international expansion and businesses to go green must be captured. "This year is really important for us, our team is going to double. At the moment we're 80 people, we are expected to hit close to 200 by the end of the year. We're opening offices internationally."Xinhua
