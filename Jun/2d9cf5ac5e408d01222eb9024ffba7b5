It has been three months and we need to accelerate the work. I am very happy about the decision that has been made in Tehran and Washington," said Borrell in a statement.For his part, Amir-Abdollahian said that he had detailed, in-depth talks on Iran's demands with Borrell, adding "we are ready to resume negotiations in the coming days."The economic benefit of the Iranian people from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is important to the Iranian government and any issue that fails to secure Iran's economic interests will not be acceptable to the government of President Ebrahim Raisi, he noted."We will try to resolve the problems and differences that exist in the course of the talks that will resume soon," he said, expressing the hope that the American side will take "realistic and fair action this time" in a run for a possible agreement.Meanwhile, in a separate meeting with Borrell later on the day, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani said Iran is looking for "a strong, stable and reliable agreement" in nuclear talks, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported.Shamkhani said "while fulfilling all our obligations in JCPOA, we have never left the negotiating table."An agreement that does not secure the lifting of "illegal" anti-Iran sanctions and does not guarantee lasting economic interests has no benefits for Iran, he noted.Iran signed the JCPOA with the world powers in July 2015 accepting to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the sanctions on Tehran. However, former US president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed Washington's unilateral sanctions on Tehran, prompting Iran to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the agreement in retaliation.Xinhua
