The ancient opera form evolved from local melodies in Kunshan, and subsequently came to dominate Chinese theater during the Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. The exhibition presents nearly 200 artworks from masters such as well-known calligrapher Huo Guoqiang.The works present ideas inspired by poems describing Kunshan and Kunqu Opera as well as the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368) Yushan Yaji, one of China's largest, longest-lasting and most creative collections of poems by Kunshan poets."We need a calligrapher like Huo who spends a lot of time and energy studying traditional Chinese culture. Holding such a vivid and colorful exhibition is the responsibility of the Kunshan Federation of Literary and Art Circles [KFLAC]," said Xu Huiquan, vice president of KFLAC, at the opening ceremony.Kunshan calligraphers including Huo and other well-known domestic painters have created a number of literary and artistic works for the exhibition showing the historical and cultural heritage of Kunshan and the essence of Kunqu Opera in a unique way. "The exhibition combines paintings, poems and calligraphy so that visitors can appreciate pure traditional beauty," said Li Yi, deputy director of the China Calligraphers Association Academy Committee, at the opening ceremony.Global Times
