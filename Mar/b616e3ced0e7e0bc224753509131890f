"Tropical fish species are able to invade temperate waters, but during the winter by far the majority of them will die off because the winters are still too cold."As the tropical fish have adapted to new waters to escape rising temperatures off the Queensland coast, the researchers also noted short-term behavioral changes."These animals are in another environment, and our study found that this actually leads to them being a bit more scared. They show more shelter behavior. They're more cautious," said Nagelkerken.He noted that these behavioral adaptations were limited and if waters continued to warm the fish would eventually be left with nowhere to go as they can't migrate any farther than Australia's easternmost point of land. "After Tasmania, there's nothing. They have a big open ocean with no habitat to settle in."While mitigating climate change is the overarching problem, the researchers highlighted the importance of minimizing the stressors on animals at the local level."We [need to] manage our fishing in a sustainable way that buys some time for these fish to adapt to climate change, so we can do something on a local scale while we'll be dealing with a global issue."Xinhua
