Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao LijianChina has never asked its citizens abroad to engage in illegal activities, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday when asked for comments about the US Department of Justice’s charges against five individuals for stalking and spying on US residents on behalf of the Chinese government.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian emphasized that the Chinese government has always urged its citizens to abide by local laws and regulations in foreign countries, saying that China strongly opposes the US’ groundless slander and smears, adding that he was not familiar with the specific details of this case.The so-called Chinese transnational repression scheme is a lie made up out of nothing and with the intention of exaggerating the threat of China and defaming its image. These efforts will not work, said Zhao, who urged the US to abandon the cold-war mindset and ideological bias and to make more efforts in promoting bilateral relations.Global Times
