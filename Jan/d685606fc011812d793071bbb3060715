Beijing is currently battling both the Omicron variant and Delta variant, and is organizing mass testing in some districts.The health code system loaded on WeChat and Beijing Tong, a Beijing government service platform, experienced the technical glitch at around 10am and resumed operation about an hour later but the one on Alipay remained default as of press time.Results of the nucleic acid test and vaccines listed on the health code system could not be checked, with the system displaying "no record of your nucleic acid test result was seen." Some residents reached by the Global Times said due to the glitch they failed to take a COVID test. Fengtai District has launched its third round of mass testing starting from Wednesday. Beijing, which has reported 71 positive COVID-19 cases since January 15, is ramping up efforts to test residents living in key and epidemic-related regions in a bid to stump out the pandemic. Previously, the health code system in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, had suffered system failure twice in the latest outbreak due to massive usage.Global Times
