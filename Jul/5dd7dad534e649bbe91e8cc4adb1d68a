The sole surviving member of an ­Islamic State group cell that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015 has not appealed his whole-life sentence for the killings, the Paris chief prosecutor said Tuesday.Salah Abdeslam, a 32-year-old Frenchman of Moroccan origin, was captured alive by police four months after the bloodbath at the Bataclan concert hall and other locations, the worst peace-time atrocity in modern French history.He was sentenced to life in prison with only a tiny chance of parole ­after 30 years, the toughest possible punishment under French law which had only been pronounced four times previously since entering into law in 1994.The 19 others sentenced for their role leading up to and following the attacks also declined to appeal, prosecutor Remy Heitz told AFP.They had 10 days to lodge any appeal after their sentencing, a deadline that expired at midnight Monday.The decision of the special court handling the cases "has now acquired permanent status and there will not be an appeal trial," he said.The trial has been the biggest in modern French history, the culmination of a six-year international investigation whose findings run to more than a million pages.All of the attackers except for Abdeslam blew themselves up or were killed by police during or after the assault.Abdeslam begun his court appearances in September by defiantly declaring himself as an "Islamic State fighter" but finished tearfully apologizing to victims and asking for leniency.In his final statement, he urged the judges not to give him a full-life term on the basis that he had not actually killed anyone. "I made mistakes, it's true. But I'm not a murderer, I'm not a killer," he said.
