Photo: Screenshot from the WeChat account of the PLA South Sea FleetThe deployment of lightweight drones on the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy's aircraft carrier Shandong sparked a wave of speculation by overseas media, which hyped that China has surpassed the US in deploying drones on aircraft carriers.Chinese analysts said such a combination could enhance the ship's logistics support capability and situational awareness, and it is nothing to be surprised about, as larger, more sophisticated drones could be onboard China's aircraft carriers soon.A fleet of drones was spotted on the flight deck of the Shandong, the Voice of America reported on Sunday, citing a picture recently circulated on social media and a number of other overseas media reports.At least seven drones of two different types could be identified in the picture, the source of which was unknown, but a watermark of China Central Television indicated its authenticity, the Voice of America said.While the resolution of the picture is limited, these fixed-wing drones are likely not high-end models, but are capable of vertical takeoff and landing, the report said.The Global Times found that the picture was indeed a screenshot taken from official reports. It first emerged in a video released by the PLA South Sea Fleet on Tuesday, then was widely reported by other PLA-affiliated media. No elaboration was given about the drones in the report.A Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Sunday on condition of anonymity that it is very normal and regular for PLA warships including destroyers and frigates to be equipped with lightweight drones, so it is not surprising to see them on aircraft carriers, which can host more of them. With limited takeoff weights, these drones do not have a long range, but can serve transport purposes among ships in a flotilla, or enhance the carrier's situational awareness when used for search or reconnaissance, the expert said.The Voice of America said that putting vertical takeoff and landing drones on aircraft carriers was originally a US concept, but it seems that China has surpassed the US in turning the idea into reality.In terms of carrier-based drone development, the US is still ahead of China, the expert said, noting that the US has already tested the likes of the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone as well as the X-47B combat drone from aircraft carriers, which are much more technologically sophisticated and of tactical significance than the drones seen on the Shandong.With China's continued aircraft carrier development, the country will also develop larger drones for aerial refueling and armed reconnaissance, the expert predicted.
