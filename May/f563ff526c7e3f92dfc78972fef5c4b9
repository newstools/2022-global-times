Data from CAAC showed that the number of average daily flights was 12,031 in 2021. The new policy applies to all large, medium and small airlines, including state-run and private airlines, all of which will be treated equally, according to the source. The application for the government subsidy is to cover the basic cost of operation, in order to ensure flying safety, restore market expectations, and maintain professional skills for personnel working in the industry, especially air crew, according to the source.The plan is reportedly submitted to the State Council for review and approval, and if things move smoothly, the subsidy is expected to start this week and end on July 20, providing a two month window to airlines. .Market watchers stated that the reason for the July 20 end date is that it coincides with the beginning of summertime travel season.The Chinese aviation industry has been living in the shadow of the pandemic for a number of years. Lv Xue'er, deputy head of CAAC, said at a meeting on Friday that although some achievements have been made in resuming normal flights and services last year, there are still some weak links, noting that China's civil aviation faces multiple difficulties such as aviation safety, epidemic prevention and control, and a slower pace of industry recovery.A Xizang Airlines flight veered off the runway aborting take-off at Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport on Thursday, leading to 36 passengers hospitalized with minor injuries and the aircraft being damaged in fire.On March 21, a China Eastern Boeing 737 with 132 people onboard crashed in South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, killing all onboard.
