They make up just 8 percent of its total land area, government analysis and data show.But in the last 16 years, more than a million families from at least 15,000 villages in the state have planted about 3.5 million saplings as part of the "Familial Forestry" project.More than a dozen participants in the program told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they were literally enjoying the fruits - and flowers - of their labor, seeing increased ground water levels, improved crop yields, and ultimately more income."The trees have changed my life. The fruits are as sweet as the ones I had as a little boy. Birds that I had not seen in decades are back," said teacher Brij Mohan Singh, as he gave out saplings to guests at a lunch event for his son's wedding."This is for my grandchildren, for the next generation. We have to leave a healthy environment for them, especially as the threat of [global warming] increases every day."Singh said he had planted five saplings at home and helped his school plant more than 7,000, which provide a cool canopy for students in the scorching summer heat, as temperatures often soar above 50 C.Laxmi Kant Sharma, professor of Earth sciences at Central Rajasthan University, praised "Familial Forestry" for tapping into India's age-old roots of conserving forest resources.But he warned that it was important to only plant indigenous trees as others often "become killers of native species of the desert" and can harm wildlife habitats.Jyani, who won the Land for Life award from the United Nations' anti-desertification agency in 2021, said he teaches communities to plant only native species such as the Khejri, Rajasthan's state tree, which requires very little water.Rich soil, healthy lifeIndia vowed to restore 26 million hectares of the country's degraded land - or nearly 27 percent - by 2030 when it hosted the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) conference in 2019.Almost 30 percent of the land in India is suffering degradation, a report by state-run space agency ISRO found in 2021.Rattan Lal, an Indian-American award-winning soil scientist whose moniker is the "Godfather of Soil Science," is urging the government to start a scheme that would pay farmers 2,325 rupees ($30) for each ton of carbon dioxide their land absorbs.Such "carbon credits" are increasingly popular financial instruments, with companies or governments that want to "offset" their own emissions paying others to reduce or prevent the release of greenhouse gases for them.Credits can support things like solar farms or planting trees, allowing farmers to monetize the carbon their fields soak up - though accurately measuring and verifying emissions reductions remains tricky.Still, such credit systems can incentivize people "for doing good," Lal said in a video interview from Columbus, Ohio.Farmers often feed their crop residue to cattle and use it to make homes and fences - or even for cooking - when it could instead be returned to the soil to boost its organic matter.Lal also suggested schools include more nature-oriented literature to spread environmental awareness early on.Celebrity Indian spiritual leader Jaggi Vasudev - known as Sadhguru - is on a one-man mission to spotlight the issue.He recently finished a 30,000-kilometer trip across Europe, the Middle East and India by motorcycle to raise awareness about the deteriorating state of the world's soil."Healthy soil and healthy life are inextricably connected," Sadhguru said at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. "In the next 10 to 15 years we can make a significant turnaround."In Rajasthan, Harinath Siddh said he had played his part by gifting and planting saplings at his wedding earlier in May.Reuters
