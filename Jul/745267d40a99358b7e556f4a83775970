The sea was divided into the upper Yangtze sea and lower Yangtze sea, connected by a narrow waterway, according to a press release by the institute on Thursday.The Tarim Basin, some 4,000 kilometers away in current Xinjiang, was connected to the southern China plate then, judging from similarities in ancient fish that lived in the two places.The coastline was identified through a unique red stratum from the Silurian Period, which is characterized by fine rocks of purple-red, yellow and gray-green. The stratum is thicker at the border of the ancient land and ocean and thinner deep inside the ocean.The indicator species was the Galeaspida, an extinct kind of jawless marine and freshwater fish, which is common in the unique red stratum. Their frequency in Silurian Period stratum and extensive existence across different regions make it an ideal species to compare and reconstruct ancient stratums.The fossils are also solid evidence to support the plate movement theory. Fish fossils found in the Bachu area in Xinjiang are highly similar to those found in Changxing, East China's Zhejiang, and in Chaohu, East China's Anhui. The species of fish did not have a long-distance migration suggesting the two areas, 4,000 kilometers apart today, belong to the same sea floor more than 400 million years ago. The plate of the Tarim Basin was close to the equator at that time.The research results were published on volume 46 of the Journal of Stratigraphy.
