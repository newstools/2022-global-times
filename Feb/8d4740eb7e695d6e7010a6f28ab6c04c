The delivery went smoothly, and this showed the PLA Navy's capabilities in far sea operations and in military missions other than war, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday.The mission was not an easy one, and many accidents could have happened, but the Chinese vessels avoided them, the expert said.The amphibious assault ship HMAS Adelaide, the largest warship of the Royal Australian Navy, was deployed to Tonga for a humanitarian mission, but has been hampered by a COVID-19 outbreak and power failure on board, media reported.
