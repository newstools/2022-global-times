Receipts in 2021 stood at over 10 billion euros.But Greece is also saddled with an unemployment rate of around 13 percent, one of the highest in the eurozone, a legacy of the near-decade debt crisis.The pandemic struck just as Greece was beginning to recover from the crisis that saw it lose a quarter of national output.In 2020, the Greek economy shrank 9 percent.People at risk of poverty or social exclusion in Greece are estimated at 28.9 percent, just behind fellow EU laggards Bulgaria and Romania according to the Hellenic Anti-Poverty Network group.The group found that in 2020, 44.6 percent of households struggled to pay rent or mortgage instalments, while 16.7 percent had inadequate heating.AFP
