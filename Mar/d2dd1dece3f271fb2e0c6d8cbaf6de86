In order to achieve the target, measures such as promoting demonstration projects of advanced reactor types such as high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, fast reactors, modular small reactors and offshore floating reactors should be conducted.The comprehensive utilization of nuclear energy in fields such as clean heating, industrial heating and seawater desalination are to be further promoted, the plan said.After more than 30 years of continuous development, China's nuclear power has achieved a major leap in terms of technology.In January 2021, the world's first demonstration project of China's independent third-generation nuclear power Hualong One in East China's Fujian Province was officially put into commercial operation, according to media reports.The operation of Hualong One shows that China's nuclear power technology has entered international leading ranks, and has become one of the important ways to achieve the nation's "dual carbon" goal.While China has maintained a high safety standard of nuclear power plant operations, nuclear energy shouldn't be broadly adopted as the major energy production source in achieving carbon neutrality, Lin said, noting that wind and solar power will still be the drivers in meeting the carbon reduction targets.The government plan also highlighted the targets for the annual production capacity of 4.6 billion tons of standard coal, 200 million tons of crude oil, 230 billion cubic meters of natural gas, and about 3 billion kilowatts of the total installed capacity for power generation in further enhancing the nation's energy reserves and the independence of energy supply capacity.As the country is moving toward green energy, the transformation of coal power from a primary power source to a basic guarantee and system-regulated power source that provides auxiliary services is to be accelerated, analysts said.
