Tepco will then dilute the water until tritium levels fall less than 1/40th of regulatory limits, before pumping it into the ocean.Even after the NRA's approval, Tepco, which plans to build a tunnel reaching into the sea for the operation, still needs to gain the consent from local communities, including the governor and mayors as well as fishermen, before starting an actual construction work, a Tepco spokesperson said.The Japanese government and Tepco have indicated that the new facilities will be completed by mid-April 2023, with the aim of starting discharge in around the spring of 2023.Before granting the initial approval, NRA has looked into various factors such as the performance of equipment for diluting water with seawater, how to stop the release of water in the event of an abnormality and counter-measures against earthquakes and tsunami, the official said.Reuters
