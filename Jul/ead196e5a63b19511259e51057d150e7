It thus also bears the date "Year eight," the eighth year of Antoninus Pius's rule.During his rule, the empire's relations with the Jews in ancient Israel greatly improved and previous decrees were revoked, the IAA noted.The coin was discovered during a survey conducted by the IAA to locate, document, research and preserve ancient sites and ancient cultural finds that are being endangered by accelerated marine development.
