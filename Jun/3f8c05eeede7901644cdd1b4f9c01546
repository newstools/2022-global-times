The number of hotel bookings in Shanghai on Tuesday already increased by 1.5 times compared with the previous day, Qunar.com said in a statement sent to the Global Times.In addition to allowing the resumption of inter-provincial group tours, some localities also announced support measures for the tourism sector, which is badly hit by COVID-19 outbreaks.

Wuzhen's Xizha and Wucun scenic spots in Zhejiang reopened to tourists on Wednesday. While fully implementing epidemic prevention measures, it launched a series of special promotions, according to a statement sent to the Global Times by the Wuzhen Xizha scenic spot on Wednesday.The MCT's targeted measure has enhanced confidence of localities to accelerate recovery of tourism, and the upcoming summer holiday is expected to further boost the recovery of the sector, said Xie Xiaoqing, a senior research fellow from the Ctrip Research Institute.With daily new cases falling under 100 nationwide, the recent Omicron flare-ups have been brought under effective control, which is great news for the tourism industry, especially as the holiday is around the corner, Jiang Yiyi, deputy head of the School of Leisure Sports and Tourism under the Beijing Sport University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.More tailored and refined measures are expected to be rolled out to prevent the spread of the virus, while minimize its impact on economic activities, Jiang said, noting that more effective COVID-prevention methods and stabilization efforts will further boost the recovery of the cultural and tourism industries.The recovery of the tourism sector will drive the growth of a swath of industries such as catering, lodging, and cultural events, Jiang said. "It is of great significance to boost domestic demand and invigorate the economy," she said.
