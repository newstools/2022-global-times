He said China is significant, open and inclusive in promoting the UN 2030 agenda. In January 2022, the Group of Friends of the GDI was launched at the UN, and more than 50 countries have joined the group so far.Egyptian Ambassador to China Mohamed Elbadri told the Global Times that Egypt is among the friends of the GDI at the UN, and is looking forward to working with other friends in pushing forward the initiative. Elbadri said he hopes a synergy could be established between GDI and the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the UNFCCC, in Egypt in November, as COP 27 is an integral part of the sustainable development.Several foreign representatives said China has played a responsible leading role in addressing many acute challenges facing the world, such as global poverty, food security and public health.  Pierre Krähenbühl, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross's Regional Delegation for East Asia, told the Global Times that China has shown leadership in the COVID-19 response, and the ICRC will work with China on the equitable distribution of vaccines, among other health issues.  He listed China's contribution in Afghanistan, where China built two hospitals and the ICRC benefited from Chinese perspectives and Chinese experiences. The report said the GDI is being translated from concept to reality, with concrete results from cooperation projects in the eight priority areas. For example, in February, the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center was inaugurated to support relevant countries in enhancing their capacity to cope with climate change and carry out relevant studies.
