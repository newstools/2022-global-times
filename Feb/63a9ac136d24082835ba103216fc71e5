"All they've got to do is come to their senses. It's up to them to resolve it."The "Freedom Convoy" demonstrations began on January 9 in western Canada as protests by truckers angry with vaccine requirements when crossing the US-Canadian border.They have since morphed into broader protests against COVID-19 health restrictions and Trudeau's government.Protest organizer Tamara Lich said activists were willing to engage with the government to find a way out of the crisis, but insisted that pandemic restrictions be eased.With the capital's center blocked and businesses forced to close, police have come under fire for the protracted crisis.To up the pressure on protesters, police Sunday announced new measures to tame the demonstrations by banning people from bringing fuel and other supplies to the rallies.Officers have since arrested several people, seized multiple vehicles and issued hundreds of traffic tickets.Protesters had been raising funds to keep up the protests, but were cut off by fundraising site GoFundMe, which said they had violated its policy against content that "promotes behavior in support of violence."AFP
