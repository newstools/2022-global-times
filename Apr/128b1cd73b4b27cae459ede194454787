China's first domestically-made aircraft carrier Shandong (Hull 17) was officially commissioned to the PLA Navy at a military port in Sanya, South China's Hainan Province, on the afternoon of December 17, 2019, making China one of the few countries in the world that have multiple carriers.

Netizens celebrated on social media, leaving comments like “I’m so excited”; “Will there be a livestream for the launch event?”; “The Type 003 is coming, when will the new J-31 carrier-based fighter jet come?”Overseas media previously reported that the third aircraft carrier was originally planned to be launched on Saturday to celebrate the PLA Navy’s 73rd founding anniversary, but it had to be postponed due to the current COVID-19 resurge in Shanghai, where the carrier is reportedly being built. Some speculations say the carrier might be named after East China’s Jiangsu Province.The construction of the third aircraft carrier was first confirmed by an official report in November 2018. The Xinhua News Agency reported at the time that a new type of aircraft carrier was in construction in an orderly manner on berth.China now has experiences with two aircraft carriers, particularly the construction of the Shandong, which enabled China to gain rich experiences that are very important to the construction of the third carrier, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Friday.According to the general pattern of aircraft carrier construction, it would take three to four years to launch a new carrier after the start of construction, and the third carrier should also follow this pattern, Song said.But the third carrier features a number of new technologies, so it might take longer. For example, commercial satellite images indicate that it is different from the previous two carriers and uses electromagnetic catapults, he said.“I think it can be launched in the second half of 2022,” Song said.
