Illustration: Xia Qing/Global TimesThe strong showing by both Chinese and foreign athletes at the ongoing Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games is encouraging the Chinese people's involvement in winter sports, especially by young people. According to statistics released by the Beijing Organising Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, a quarter of Chinese people had taken part in ice and snow sports by October last year. Young people are the main driving force. Ever since Beijing won the bid to host the 2022 Games in 2015, investors have long cast their eyes on the Olympic dividends and relied on younger generations to spur a snow sports boom. But risks accompany the ice world fairytale. The cost of venues and equipment is high. The season is conditional. Compared with already popular recreation like yoga and fitness, ice and snow sports are still in their budding phase. What is certain is that young people's understanding and enthusiasm toward the ice and snow world will boom. This is a test for the sensitivity of the market and the wisdom of investors to make it last.
