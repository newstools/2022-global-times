Pope Francis on Monday apologized for the "evil" inflicted on the Indigenous peoples of Canada on the first day of a visit focused on addressing decades of abuse at Catholic-run residential schools.The plea for forgiveness from the leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics was met with applause by a crowd of First Nations, Metis and Inuit people in Maskwacis, in western Alberta Province - some of whom were taken from their families as children in what has been branded a "cultural genocide." "I am sorry," said the 85-year-old pontiff, as he delivered his address at the site of one of the largest of Canada's infamous residential schools, where Indigenous children were sent as part of a policy of forced assimilation. "I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples."From the late 1800s to the 1990s, Canada's government sent about 150,000 children into 139 residential schools run by the Church, where they were cut off from their families, language and culture.Many were physically and sexually abused, and thousands are believed to have died of disease, malnutrition or neglect. During a ceremony performed before the pope spoke, Indigenous people carried a bright red 50-­meter-long banner on which the names of all the children known to have died were written in white. There were 4,120 of them, officials said.Since May 2021, more than 1,300 unmarked graves have been discovered at the sites of the former schools, sending shock waves throughout Canada.
