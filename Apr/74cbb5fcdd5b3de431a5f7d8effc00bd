Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, however, the energy debate has been revived in the country, which is heavily dependent on Russian hydrocarbons, particularly for gas, which accounts for some 55 percent of its energy imports.To ensure sufficient electricity production while reducing dependence on Russian imports, the German government gave itself the option in March of "suspending" the closure of certain coal-fired power stations, while standing by the objective of phasing out coal by 2030.Lutzerath has become the new rallying point of the German environmental movement. Activists have built huts and are preparing for a confrontation with police.The coal that lies under the ground in these municipalities will be "necessary from 2024" to supply power stations, while other mines in the region are closing, according to the operator, the RWE group.AFP
