Ambassador Chen XuAt the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, Chen Xu, China's Permanent Representative to the UN Office in Geneva stated that on behalf of more than 90 countries, China called on all parties to focus on economic recovery and protection of social and cultural rights within the context of addressing inequalities in a post-pandemic world.Chen said that "two years on, the world is still grappling with the devastating consequences of the COVID pandemic on human lives, health, and development."By compounding the existing socio-economic challenges, the virus has enlarged the structural inequalities within and among countries, and those in vulnerable and marginalized situations are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the loss of millions of human lives, COVID vaccine inequity continues to widen, said Chen.The Chinese ambassador noted that unfortunately, global economic recovery from the pandemic is unbalanced. Constrained by an increasing liquidity crunch, developing countries are literally struggling to recover their economies, alleviate poverty, counter discrimination and improve livelihoods."We emphasize that the COVID-19 pandemic can be countered effectively only through international cooperation, unity, solidarity and collective action, based on a multilateral approach, and strong international institutions. The resolution 49/19, adopted by this Council, is a step in this direction," said ChenThe resolution 49/19 -"Promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights within the context of addressing inequalities in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic" - spotlights the mutually reinforcing relationship between addressing inequalities and the enjoyment and realization of economic, social, and cultural rights by those in vulnerable and marginalized situations. Additionally, the resolution aims at empowering the office of the High Commissioner of the UN human rights to reinforce its work in this intersecting area, with a special focus on the needs of developing countries, said Chen."We look forward to active participation and constructive discussions at the mandated 3-day workshop," said Chen, noting that the Monday joint statement is supported by 91 countries.Global Times
