"Three months before an election, we could have expected investors to be in wait-and-see mode because of the uncertainty of an election. Instead, we see very strong confidence from foreign investors in the president's economic policy," he said.Since 2017, Macron has pushed through a cocktail of supply-side economic reforms meant to boost businesses' competitiveness, cut taxes on investors and loosen strict labor market rules.Critics say he has acted as "president of the rich" who wants to do away with France's cherished social safety nets and has cut welfare benefits for some of the poorest.But three months ahead of the April election, indicators show the French economy is booming, with growth expected to have hit 6.7 percent in 2021 and France having returned closer to pre-pandemic levels than any G7 peer bar the United States.Macron supporters also received an unexpected boost from economist Paul Krugman on Friday."In fact, among major advanced economies, the star performer of the pandemic era, arguably, is … France," he wrote in his New York Times column.Antoine Bristielle, director of opinion at the Fondation Jean Jaures think tank, said the current priority for French voters was purchasing power and making ends meet. "But in second place is COVID-19, which has made a spectacular return as an election concern in recent months," he said. Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant at the pollsters Viavoice, said 57 percent of French people defined their current state of mind as "fatigued," worsened by the pandemic.
