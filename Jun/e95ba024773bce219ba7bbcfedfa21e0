The quota for businesses from the newly added regions is capped at $5 million.In an effort to ensure that foreign debt financing is truly tapped for real economic development, the forex regulator stipulated that businesses must be registered in the pilot regions and be operational for at least one year. Only non-financial firms - property developers and businesses with local government financing vehicles are excluded - that are accredited by national or local authorities as high-tech or the aforementioned specialized, refined and new SMEs would qualify for the program.In addition, qualified businesses' access to foreign debt is banned from securities investment, real estate purchases, and investment in property developers and local governments' financing vehicles.The cross-border funding program was initiated by the SAFE in the Zhongguancun national innovation demonstration zone, Beijing's tech hub in March 2018 before being expanded to cover the nine regions including Shanghai, South China's Guangdong Province and South China's Hainan Province. Global Times
