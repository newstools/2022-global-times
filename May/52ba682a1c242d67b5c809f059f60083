"We firmly oppose this," he said.Wu also pointed out that Japan's close-range tracking and disruptions were very dangerous that could have easily led to misunderstandings, misjudgments and accidents.China demands that Japan  stop all meaningless disruptions and safeguard bilateral ties as well as regional peace and stability with actions, as what Japan did is not beneficial to mutual trust and caused serious threats to the safety of both sides' vessels, aircraft and personnel.Japan has been tracking and monitoring Chinese military activities for years, repeatedly calling them threats and provocations despite admitting that the Chinese vessels and aircraft did not enter Japanese territory. The US stations a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in Japan and frequently sends other vessels for training near Japan. Why doesn't Japan protest  the US? observers asked.Japan has some ulterior motives, Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the Naval Research Academy of the PLA, told the Global Times on Thursday.By hyping the "China threat" theory, Japan is finding excuses to develop offensive weapons and military capabilities, Zhang said, noting that Japan exposed this intention by again mentioning it will enhance so-called counterattack capabilities and increase its defense budget during the recent meeting between top US and Japanese leaders.Japan is also trying to shift the public attention away from its own provocative military activities like reconnaissance, patrols and drills in the East China Sea and South China Sea, Zhang said.
