When this baby hits 88 miles per hour... it's probably not going to take you Back to the Future, but it might just transport a dedicated film buff to weekend runaround heaven.The wing-doored DeLorean, with an "OUTATIME" license plate and a mock-up flux capacitor, is among a host of movie memorabilia up for auction in California in June.But unlike Thor's Hammer, Obi Wan Kenobi's lightsaber or Wilson the spiky-haired volleyball-cum-friend from Castaway, which are also on the block, the DeLorean doesn't just have to sit on display: You can actually drive it."This DeLorean is fully operational, registered and insured with... current mileage of 22,532," says the auction catalog published by movie specialists Propstore."As this is a functioning vehicle, a legal transfer of title will need to take place before delivery can be arranged."The car, which was used for events promoting Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future trilogy, is expected to shift for between $150,000 and $200,000.Anyone after a slightly less Earth-bound vehicle might want to consider splashing out up to $1 million on an X-Wing that took part in the attack on the Death Star at the end of the original Star Wars."We were able to match it to a scene where the Red leader goes down, so you actually see this particular one on screen," said Chuck Costas, Propstore vice president.The catch is that it's only around two feet (60 centimeters) long - a little small for a stormtrooper, as the saying goes. And that's not the only object up for sale."Many of the objects come from collectors, but also from the studios themselves, or they may have belonged to people who actually worked on the filming of the movies at the time," said Costas."We have things that are in the hundreds of dollars all the way to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So there's always something from your favorite movie that's in your price range."
