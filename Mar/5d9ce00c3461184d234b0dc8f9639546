In the process, an Australian P-8A maritime patrol aircraft detected a laser emanating from one of the two PLA Navy vessels, illuminating the aircraft while in flight north of Australia.Australia accused the Chinese move of "unprofessional and unsafe," and "could have endangered the safety and lives of the Australian personnel."Images released by the Australian Defense Department show that the two PLA warships are the Hefei and the Jinggangshan which were taking part in the far sea joint training flotilla revealed on Thursday.Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, said on February 21 that Australia's statement is completely inconsistent with the facts, and it was the Australian aircraft that flew close to the Chinese vessels and provocatively dropped sonobuoys.The PLA Navy's far sea drills have become routine, observers said. For example, a taskforce consisting of a Type 052D destroyer, a Type 054A frigate, a Type 071 amphibious landing ship and a Type 903A comprehensive replenishment ship, conducted a month-long joint drill in the South China Sea, the West Pacific and the Central Pacific in February 2019.This combination of warships has become routine, as training is performed in a long range for an extended period of time and under realistic combat-oriented situations, a Chinese military expert who requested to remain anonymous told the Global Times on Thursday.In the latest drill, Chinese warships dealt well with close-range tracking and monitoring by foreign vessels and aircrafts like those from Australia, the expert said, noting that this proved their capabilities and provided a great opportunity to train in realistic combat scenarios.Judging from the types of ships that participated in the drills, the flotilla has high amphibious landing capabilities and can carry out traditional and non-traditional security missions, like humanitarian aid, anti-piracy, anti-terrorism, disaster relief and evacuation of nationals, experts said.
