According to the Lab, it is a top-of-the-line backdoor created by Equation, an elite hacking group affiliated with the US National Security Agency (NSA). It is used to peek into and control the networks of victim groups. So far, 45 countries and regions around the world have been affected.This is the first time that Chinese researchers have publicly exposed the complete chain of technical evidence about the advanced persistent threat (APT) attack launched by the US-based Equation hacker group. According to cybersecurity experts from the lab, "Telescreen" (Bvp47) operation has been raging around the world for more than a decade, infiltrating 45 countries and regions including China, Russia, Japan, Germany, Spain and Italy, and involving 287 important institutional targets. Japan, though a victim, has also been used as a springboard to launch attacks on targets in other countries.At present, the global APT attacks are increasingly frequent with a wider range of aggression, greater harm and concealment. China is one of the countries most exposed to APT attacks. Chinese cybersecurity experts have called for governments and industrial chains around the world to work together to effectively deal with threats and safeguard cyber security.The story will be updated later.
