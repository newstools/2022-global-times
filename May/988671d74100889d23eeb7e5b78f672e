China FranceChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday held a phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, as both sides agreed that related parties should support Russia and Ukraine to resume peace through negotiations. Xi reiterated that China has always been promoting peace talks with its own methods, reitering that China supports European countries to grasp their security in their own hands. Xi warned against confrontation between camps as it poses bigger and sustained threats to global security and stability. Macron said that France shared many consensuses with China over the Ukraine crisis and is willing to work with China to coordinate the issue. France, as well as the EU, insists on strategic autonomy, disagrees with group-group conflict and will not participate in such conflicts, Macron said.The two also exchanged ideas on bilateral ties and agreed to enhance exchanges in various fields, including nuclear energy, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean energy. The conversation with Macron came one day after Xi met via video link with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, during which they exchanged views on bilateral ties, China-EU relations as well as the Ukraine crisis.   The conversation with leaders of two major European countries in two consecutive days came amid growing worries that the Russia and Ukraine conflict, which started on February 24, may continue to last for a long period as the US and some European countries continue to provide weapons to Ukraine, pointed out Feng Zhongping, director of the Institute of European Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Xi's two conversations with the two European leaders at this time demonstrates to the world China's attitude toward the crisis that China hopes to work with European countries to seek a peaceful and early resolution to the crisis, Feng told the Global Times on Tuesday.If the Russia-Ukraine war continues to escalate, it will bring about a great long-term influence to Europe and the world. Rather than imposing sanctions against Russia following the US, European countries are able to make more efforts to prevent the Russia-Ukraine crisis from escalating, Feng said.    During the conversation with Macron, Xi also pointed out that over the past five years, he and Macron have kept close contact, led China-France relations to maintain a positive momentum of development, pushed for fruitful results in bilateral cooperation, and demonstrated the responsibilities of major countries in addressing issues such as climate change and biodiversity conservation.He said that in the face of profound changes unseen in a century, China and France, both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and independent major countries, should adhere to the original aspiration of the establishment of the diplomatic relations featuring independence, mutual understanding, foresight, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, stick to the positioning of a close and lasting comprehensive strategic partnership, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and closely coordinate and cooperate at the bilateral, China-Europe and global levels.The Chinese side is ready to work with France to continue keeping close exchanges at all levels, push for sound development of bilateral relations and safeguard world peace and stability, Xi added.
