Turkey receivies nearly a quarter of the plastic waste exported by EU nations in 2019.

Maybe we can't tolerate more," the Sweden-based researcher said in a statement.For several years, the Stockholm Resilience Centre has been conducting studies on "planetary boundaries" in nine areas that influence Earth's stability, such as greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater usage and the ozone layer.The aim is to determine if mankind is in a "safe operating space" or if the limits are being exceeded and threaten the future of the planet.AFP
