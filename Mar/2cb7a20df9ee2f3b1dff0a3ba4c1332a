It is estimated that the overall market size of ice and snow sports will reach 785.29 billion yuan ($124.38 billion) in 2022, according to a report sent by iiMedia Research Institute to the Global Times.It is believed that with the increase in the number of snow and ice sports events, and multiple favorable policies, the market will continue to expand, per the iiMedia report.
