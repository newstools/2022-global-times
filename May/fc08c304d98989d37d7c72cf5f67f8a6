The record number plus the disruptions caused by the pandemic will lead to mounting pressure for youth, experts noted.In response, both the central and local governments have ramped up efforts to stabilize employment by rolling out effective measures.On Friday, the State Council, China's cabinet, announced measures to help young people, especially college graduates, find jobs and set up businesses. Detailed support policies in a document included subsidies to employers that hire more graduates and guaranteed loans for young entrepreneurs.A notice issued recently by the human resources authority of East China's Jiangsu Province underscored the driving role of investment in creating new jobs, and it put the employment of college graduates as the top priority.A prerequisite for securing employment is to first secure market entities, according to Qiao Baoyun, head of the Central University of Finance and Economics' China Academy of Public Finance and Policy. He pointed out that market entities are faced with major problems such as rising financing costs that need to be addressed."The government will further reduce taxes and fees, and bolster support for the real economy this year, which will be conducive to helping enterprises and stabilizing jobs," said the NBS spokesperson.Apart from government support measures, enterprises and recruitment platforms are making efforts to facilitate employment, by fully utilizing the country's advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) while adopting trending platforms, including livestreaming, to conduct online exams and interviews. Zhaopin.com, one of China's largest online recruitment platforms, has implemented a mechanism for enterprises to select interviewees by incorporating AI technology, as the mechanism will automatically score applicants based on smart analysis to evaluate their performance, according to a report it sent to the Global Times on Monday.The platform has also adopted livestreaming as a means to connect enterprise and fresh graduates, which can more efficiently match applicants with suitable positions and simplify the hiring process.
