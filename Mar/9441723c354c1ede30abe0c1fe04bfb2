Cyber security Photo: IC A Chinese political adviser called on China to build a digital security emergency response system to address challenges brought by cyberattacks on data relating to key infrastructure, cities and major enterprises which are the primary target. Digital security investment ratio in developed countries accounts for about 10 percent of the overall IT investment, while the number in China is merely less than 1 percent, Zhou Hongyi, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), also chairman and CEO of Qihoo 360 Technology, pointed out in his 2022's Two Sessions proposals obtained by the Global Times on Tuesday.The digital security emergency response system should address the challenges and threats in all digital fields such as industrial internet, connected vehicles, smart cities, cloud security, data security and supply chain, Zhou proposed. Digital security should be incorporated into new infrastructure at the beginning of any digital construction and connect all digital construction with each other to mobilize all social forces to participate in the construction of a digital security system, thus improving the country's digital security, Zhou noted. In smart vehicle industry, Zhou suggested all smart vehicles to undergo a compulsory security test before entering the market. Citing data calculated by 360 connected vehicles security laboratory, Zhou said the 360 company has detected more than 1,600 vulnerabilities among the 53 models of smart vehicles sold by 25 domestic automobile companies.More than 1,000 of these security vulnerabilities were found in the cloud, which means attackers are capable of remotely controlling all intelligent cars of a certain brand. 600 vehicle-related security vulnerabilities were found to be particularly exposed to being manipulated by attackers. For instance, the attackers can open and close the door or start the engine.To address IT infrastructure security, China published an administrative regulation on major IT infrastructure security. The regulations stipulate that IT infrastructure projects, which refer to IT network facilities and information systems of major industries in key areas, will come under the country's special protection, Xinhua News Agency reported. Measures including monitoring, defense and proper handling of cybersecurity risks and threats from both home and overseas will be carried out so as to ensure that relevant facilities are protected from attacks, intrusions, interference and sabotage.
