Poll body data showed that over 18,000 national and local positions are up for grabs.In April's final opinion poll of registered voters, former senator Ferdinand Marcos Jr, 64, son of former president Ferdinand Marcos, led Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, 56, and eight other candidates.On Saturday, the last day of the campaign period, millions of Filipinos took to the streets to support their preferred presidential aspirants.Marcos' camp claimed that up to a million attended the miting de avance of Marcos and his running mate Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio on Saturday night in Paranaque City in the capital region. In the Philippines, miting de advance is traditionally the final campaign event for the candidates running for local and national posts.Marcos called for unity, saying he longs for the day when Filipinos unite to better the country. "Filipinos are starting to unite even before the election after heeding the message of our UniTeam," he told his supporters wearing red and green, the campaign color of Marcos and Carpio, respectively.Robredo's organizers claimed nearly 800,000 came to support the incumbent vice president and her running-mate, Senator Francisco Pangilinan, gathering at the heart of Makati City's central business district in a final show of force on Saturday."Let's celebrate a historic campaign tonight. Let's go!

On the campaign trail, politicians seek first to entertain voters by singing and dancing on stage and even hire popular actors to join them in the hustings.After the crowd is entertained, they also discuss how they intend to revitalize the economy amid the lingering pandemic, reduce unemployment, and stamp out pervasive corruption.Xinhua
