A total of 381,800 public visits and letters have been handled since 2018 through face-to-face and online petitioning channels," Song said.Song said that more than 2.6 million people's congress deputies at county- and township-level have been picked out through one-person-one-vote election by more than 1 billion voters, which is a vivid practice of China's comprehensive-process democracy.The NPC Standing Committee said that the people's congress system, the fundamental political system in China, has become more mature over the past 10 years with a much improved legal system focusing on major concerns of the Chinese people and government's strategic plans, such as poverty alleviation, anti-pollution and financial risks prevention.
