I come to ask you for help." Maduro's reelection in 2018 in a vote boycotted by the opposition is not recognized by part of the international community and in particular the United States, which backs the opposition.Some 500 opposition supporters, joined by leader Juan Guaido, also gathered in Caracas in a parallel rally.Guaido called for "unity" in the wake of the defeat of a divided opposition in regional elections in November. "We pledge today to fight... we must strengthen unity," he said, promising to revive the street protests that rocked the government in 2019 but eventually died out. AFP
