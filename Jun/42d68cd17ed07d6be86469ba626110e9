The conservative candidate won the first round of Colombia's presidential election Sunday but fell short of the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff next month. The 41-year-old senator will face former guerrilla leader Gustavo Petro on June 17, the first leftist candidate to contest a runoff election in Columbia.
