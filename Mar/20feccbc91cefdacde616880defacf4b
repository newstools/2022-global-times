However, Lady Chief Justice Keegan dismissed both cases.Ahead of elections to Northern Ireland's devolved assembly in May, the province's politics have been plunged into crisis by issues surrounding the protocol.In February, Paul Givan, the unionist leader of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive, resigned from his position in protest against the post-Brexit trade mechanism, prompting the collapse of the devolved government. The move has further complicated post-Brexit negotiations between Brussels and London - which has said it is also opposed to the protocol.Issues surrounding the protocol overshadowed a recent visit by Irish prime minister Micheal Martin to London, where the Taoiseach looked to show a united front with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the Ukraine crisis. AFP
