The team said factors such as highly-contagious Omicron, increasing flow of people during the back-to-school season and people's relaxing mindset during the holiday on epidemic propelled such high number of infections recently.Based on the current situation, the global pandemic would subside by the end of 2023 with the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide reaching 750 million, the Global COVID-19 Prediction System predicted. While global infections are rising quickly due to highly-contagious Omicron, China should still maintain a dynamic zero case policy while strictly guarding against imported and domestic rebounds, as China cannot take the risk of allowing the general population to contract with the virus, as a larger number of infections leads to more deaths, the expert's team said, adding that the country has made people's health and lives the priority by adopting the dynamic zero case policy.If China relaxes restrictive policies, an outbreak occurs in the country would lead to more than 10 million infections. China's strategy to prevent the return of a domestic outbreak and imported COVID-19 cases and the dynamic zero-COVID approach are still the best plan to deal with the pandemic, Huang's team previously told the Global Times.To further reduce the negative impact that epidemic will inflict on the country and people and better cope with future global pandemic, Huang's team suggested strengthening the monitoring capability of virus in the environment and how climate and environment affects the spread of pathogenic microorganism, and establishing a global and regional pre-warning epidemic system.
