Spain and Portugal were sweltering in their second heat wave in a month on Monday, with scorching temperatures also ­expected in France and Britain in the coming days.People in Spain baked with the temperature in the central town of Candeleda hitting a stifling 43.3 C shortly after 6 pm (16:00 GMT), according to Spain's meteorological agency AEMET.The mercury meanwhile hit 42.4 C in the southern city of Seville.The southwestern cities of Badajoz and Merida also saw temperatures of 42 C.AEMET forecast 46 C in Badajoz on Thursday and Friday with Seville predicted to swelter in 45 C on Wednesday and Thursday."This heat wave really has the potential to be exceptional," said AEMET spokesperson ­Ruben del Campo.The current temperature surge began Sunday and could "last nine or 10 days, which would make it one of the three longest heat waves Spain has seen since 1975," the spokesperson told AFP.Heat waves have become more frequent due to climate change, scientists say. As global temperatures rise over time, heat waves are ­expected to become more intense.June had already seen Spain grapple with temperatures above 40 C in swathes of the country.The previous month was Spain's hottest May since the beginning of the century.In August 2021, Spain recorded its highest ever temperature when the mercury reached 47.4 C in the small southern town of Montoro. Meteorologists did not rule out the prospect of that record being broken in the coming days.In neighboring Portugal, temperatures topped 44 C over the weekend, fuelling wildfires and vast smoke clouds which were visible in the capital Lisbon.Firefighters brought the largest blaze under control on Monday after it had burned through swathes of the central municipality of Ourem, local officials said.While temperatures eased somewhat in Portugal on Monday, they were expected to soar again in the coming days with 44 C forecast for the southeastern city of Evora.A front of hot air began pushing into France on Monday, with the mercury rising above 30 C across much of the country, according to national weather forecaster Meteo-France.Temperatures could hit 39 C in some parts of France on Tuesday, it added.Britain on Monday issued an extreme heat warning, with temperatures predicted to hit more than 30 C across large parts of England and Wales.The extreme heat warning was classified as "amber," the second-highest alert level, indicating a "high impact" on daily life and people.
