(Xinhua/Jia Haocheng)The torch relay logo for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games drew its inspiration from the Chinese phoenix and the symbol of fire, the two important totems in Chinese traditional culture. As the "bird of god" in the country's legends, the phoenix is a symbol of peace, happiness and harmony in ­society. And for fire, it not only played an indispensable role in ancient people's lives, but also an inspiration of the ancestors as ancient Chinese believed in its enormous vitality. Covered in gold and red, the logo designers believe that the color combination shows a sense of justice as well as the supreme honor.As the essence of the Olympic Games, the torch relay has been a way to show the value of sports and to create a sporty atmosphere in the host city. The logo of the torch relay is an important visual cultural content of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.The logo has also been placed on many Beijing 2022 Olympic Games-related designs such as the Olympic torch, the ceremonial platform for placing the Olympic flame, the torchbearer's clothes and the Beijing Winter Olympic flame lantern, whose design took inspiration from the Changxin Palace Lantern, a bronze relic dating to the Western Han Dynasty (206BC-AD25). The torches holding the Olympic fire of the Beijing Games were passed to the three main competition venues in Zhangjiakou, Yanqing and downtown Beijing from February 2 to 4.
