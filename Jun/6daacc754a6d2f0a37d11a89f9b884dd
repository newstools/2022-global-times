Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin Photo: fmprc.gov.cnChina will send additional emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan with cash, tents, quilts and other supplies being prepared, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday, after the 5.9-magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of Afghanistan including the capital city Kabul early Wednesday and resulted in at least 1,500 deaths. On top of the previous assistance, China will send an additional amount of emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan as earthquake relief efforts. China is stepping up efforts to prepare cash, tents, quilts and other supplies through local governments, the Red Cross Society of China, enterprises and other channels to send them to disaster-hit areas in Afghanistan as soon as possible, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at Friday's press briefing. China expressed sympathy to Afghanistan immediately after the earthquake and expressed readiness to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The food support promised by China has arrived in Afghanistan and is being distributed quickly, and China is also ready to strengthen cooperation with Afghanistan on disaster prevention and reduction, especially disaster monitoring and forecasting, Wang said. Haibatullah Akhundzada, the supreme leader of the Taliban-run administration, has sought assistance from the international community, Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday. Countries like China, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey have pledged humanitarian assistance to quake-affected areas, according to Xinhua. We believe that with the concerted efforts of the Afghan interim government and all sectors of society and the help of the international community, the people in the quake-hit areas will overcome difficulties and return to normal life and work at an early date, Wang said. The island of Taiwan announced on Thursday that it will donate $1 million to Afghanistan for disaster relief, and in response to questions on the Chinese mainland's comments, Wang said Taiwan is part of China, and the one-China principle is a universally recognized basic norm governing international relations. He noted that the political attempt by the Taiwan authorities to expand its so-called "international space" under the guise of aid will never succeed.Global Times
