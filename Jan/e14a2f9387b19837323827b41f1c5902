Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao LijianThe UN Security Council has no plans to discuss a draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday, calling on members of the Security Council to focus on advancing the political settlement process of the Peninsula issue. He made the remarks at Wednesday's press conference after being asked whether China will take issue with the reported US' push on the UN Security Council to impose a new round of sanctions against North Korea.The Biden administration imposed its first sanctions on North Korea on January 12, in response to North Korea's missile tests earlier this month, according to a report from the BBC. On Monday, North Korea fired two short-range missiles into waters off the coast of Japan, the latest in an unusual flurry of tests, the BBC cited South Korea's military as saying.In response, a foreign ministry spokesperson in Pyongyang said that the sanctions launched by the US were "intentionally escalating" the situation, and if "the US adopts such a confrontational stance, the DPRK will be forced to take stronger and certain reaction to it".On Wednesday, Zhao called on the members of the UN Security Council to focus on advancing the political settlement process of the Peninsula issue, give serious consideration to China's proposal, and make positive effort to stabilize the situation, accumulate mutual trust and resume dialogue.Global Times
