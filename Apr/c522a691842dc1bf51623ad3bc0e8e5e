Xi urged efforts to better serve the construction of the new land-sea transit routes for western China and the Belt and Road Initiative.Describing the island, covering 35,400 square kilometers, as the country's biggest testing ground for addressing institutional weak links, experts are hoping for innovations initially trialed on the island to feed strength into the country's security and indigenousness-oriented economic policymaking.

He called for ensuring the smooth launch of independent customs operation of the free trade port as scheduled.At a media briefing hosted by the provincial government on Wednesday, a raft of impressive numbers was disclosed, shedding light on progress on the free trade port's reforms.Over 150 policy announcements have been made for the free trade port, the province's office of deepening reform told the briefing. The push for "integrated institutional innovation" which tops the FTP's agenda has resulted in the setting up of the country's first provincial-level reform and institutional reform prize with 123 institutional innovation cases having been unveiled.An action plan for the FTP's institutional innovations (2020-22) has thus far been 73.3 percent completed, the Hainan Daily reported on Monday.A typical example of such innovations is an operation team of an international agricultural technology incubator in Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City in Sanya, local news site hinews.cn reported on Tuesday. With only nine people, the team has introduced and incubated 30 sci-tech firms over merely four months, per the report, citing the local improved business environment in the wake of the institutional innovation push.Xi visited Sanya on Sunday, where he visited a seed laboratory to learn about seed industry innovation. "To ensure that China's seed resources are self-supporting and under better control, self-reliance must be achieved in seed technology," he said.The FTP has over the years practiced the mentality that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets," per the Wednesday briefing. New-energy vehicle ownership as a part of the province's total car ownership hit 7.2 percent, 4.6 percentage points higher than the national level. The province's clean energy capacity as a percentage of its total installments totaled 70 percent, 23 percentage points higher than the national reading. During his visit to a section of a tropical rainforest national park in the city of Wuzhishan on Monday, Xi stressed the importance of boosting national park development in Hainan Province.The construction of Hainan free trade port is making steady progress in line with the central government's guidance, with a lot of work done in the island in such aspects as implementing zero-tariff policy, reinforcing industrial foundation and carrying out all-round reform and opening-up, said Song Ding, a research fellow at the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute.Still, relevant work is in the preliminary stage of phasing in trade port policies and necessary institutional framework, Song told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that Hainan - the world's largest free trade port in terms of coverage - cannot simply copy the experience of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Singapore or Dubai.Aside from exploring detailed policies to develop the island into a bridgehead connecting the Chinese mainland with the international community, Hainan needs to strengthen its own attraction for capital, technologies, talent and multinational companies to become an influential and high-level free trade port, Song said.An official with the provincial finance department said at the same briefing on Wednesday that 11 favorable tax policies have been implemented to complement the FTP.Local authorities in Hainan are working toward establishing an island-wide customs clearance mechanism, while gradually setting up a tax regime for promoting liberalization and facilitation of free trade and investment, the official said.The island province has seen rapid growth in foreign trade in the past four years, with an expansion of nearly 75 percent. 　 In 2021, the total value of Hainan's imports and exports was 147.7 billion yuan ($23.2 billion), up 57.7 percent year-on-year, 36.3 percentage points faster than the national growth of foreign trade, according to local customs. This compares with a reading of 84.9 billion yuan in 2018. Additionally, more efforts are needed to develop the island's modern services sector, including finance, shipping and technological innovation to build a solid foundation for the free trade port, according to Jiao Xinwang, director of the China Manufacturing Think Tank.
