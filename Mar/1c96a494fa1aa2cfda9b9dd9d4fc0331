The energy cooperation will help Laos improve its electricity supply and improve the living standard of local residents by addressing the electricity shortage, as well as promoting the export of surplus electricity from Laos," Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Laos is rich in electricity resources, with a total installed hydropower capacity of nearly 10,000 megawatts and an average annual power generation of more than 50 billion kilowatt-hours, but its deployment capacity is seriously insufficient, thus leading to huge abandoned water and electricity facilities, Jiang said.Jiang added that room for energy cooperation between China and Laos is not limited, but both countries should avoid exceeding grid capacity, in order to promote the benign development of Laos' power industry and ease the pressure of business operation.Daovong Phonekeo, Minister of Energy and Mines of Laos, said that Laos attaches great importance to the development of the energy sector, noting that the country will continue to strengthen energy cooperation with China, aimed at mutual benefit and green development.Under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese companies have contributed to infrastructure construction in Laos. On September 27, 2021, the power supply project for the China-Laos Railway was put into operation, which will guarantee the smooth operation of the railway and promote the establishment of the China-Laos community with a shared future, experts noted.Since its launch on December 3, the China-Laos Railway has seen major progress. During China's Spring Festival travel rush from January 17 to February 25, the China-Laos Railway ran at full capacity, carrying more than 700,000 passengers and over 170,000 tons of goods, transport officials in Yunnan said.Global Times
