The shopkeeper carefully cleaned its feathers, feet and breast, while the chicken closed its eyes in bliss.The chicken's owner, surnamed Bao, said that the chicken, named Elizabeth, had been raised in the countryside. Bao said that he regarded the chicken as his spiritual totem, as he thought it was extremely resilient.The house where Elizabeth was kept was located in a harsh environment, with wild cats, dogs, and weasels on the hills, but the chicken still lived on its own and wandered the hills every day.When Bao and his friends went back to the countryside and saw that the chicken was dirty, they came up with the idea of giving it a bath. Being Afraid that the cold water in the village would make the chicken sick, he decided to bring it to the city.Since none of other pet shops had ever bathed a chicken, the owner was amused by the request and was finally persuaded to give it a try by charging Bao $30 (200 yuan) for the service.The video of the chicken being bathed has received more than a million likes, and the chicken's owner said he will continue to update viewers on Elizabeth's story.Global Times
