"We took out whatever we could," she said, and took the children to what was thought to be a secure outbuilding. "As soon as we took them out then the bedroom started collapsing," she said.The family then moved to an outbuilding, which had also been damaged but held together for the rest of the night.That building has since collapsed and they are now "squatting" in her brother's two-bedroom house where 12 people are crammed.Worshippers at the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa raised hands as tears rolled down, while others fell to the ground during emotional prayers."The loss of life, destruction of homes, the damage to the physical infrastructure... make this natural disaster one of the worst ever in recorded history of our province," said Sihle Zikalala, premier of the KwaZulu-Natal Province.Rains were starting to let up on Sunday, allowing for search and relief aid operations to continue in and around Durban. AFP
