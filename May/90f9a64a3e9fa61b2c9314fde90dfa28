All 30 NATO members must approve plans to enlarge the alliance. Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey's commitment to NATO was unchanged, and he called on allies to focus their efforts on "persuading" the candidate countries."Sweden's and Finland's uncompromising insistence on joining the alliance has added an unnecessary item to NATO's agenda," he said. "There is no authority in Ankara that can be told what to do by any country that is unwilling to fight terrorism."Sullivan also "reiterated the importance of refraining from escalation in Syria to preserve existing cease-fire lines and avoid any further destabilization," the White House said.Reuters
