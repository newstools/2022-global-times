I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be." Smith also apologized to the Academy, the producers of the show, all attendees and everyone watching the telecast around the world. The apology came after the incident at the 94th Academy Awards when the actor hit Chris Rock in the face on stage after the comedian made a joke about the shaved head of the actor's wife, who cut the hair because of the hair-loss condition.Smith then won his first Oscar for playing the father of tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams in the film King Richard.Smith's Oscars slap and apology statement have gained more than 101 million views and comments on Weibo as of press time, as some Chinese netizens said the slap was not proper but understandable."I oppose violent behavior. But imagine taking the disease of someone's family for a joke. Rock deserved this!" said one netizen. "Perhaps the only good thing of the incident is that it has lifted the audience rating," joked another.Global Times
