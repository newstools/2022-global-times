Ma said, "Taiwan is a part of China and the Taiwan question has always been an internal affair of China."The DPP authority is trying to deceive the world to cover up the fact that their provocation for secession is the cause of current tensions across the Taiwan Straits, Ma added."What's more, they have become the pawn to contain China's development by following external anti-China forces. They misjudged the situation and became obsessed with relying on external forces to back them up. At the same time, it revealed their lack of confidence in constantly seeking 'reassuring pills,'" Ma said."The future of Taiwan is determined by all Chinese people, and the Chinese have the overwhelming courage and ability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity," Ma said.
