Leave some space for art,” another netizen wrote.Some netizens said those who triggered the topic were “picking out bones from an egg.”On May 6, a netizen posted a notice on Xiaohongshu, a lifestyle-focused social media platform, claiming that the packaging design of the Nongfu Spring beverage includes an elephant performing in a circus. It might be the company’s inadvertent mistake, but any animal show will remind us that the animals have suffered in training, the netizen said in the post, according to media reports.The netizen called for a change to the design and later the news got more attention. Earlier, whether an elephant named Molly had been abused in a zoo in Central China’s Henan Province also triggered a heated discussion online, with many celebrities supporting more protection for the elephant.
