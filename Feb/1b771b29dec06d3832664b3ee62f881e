From the beginning of the 14th Five-year Plan period (2021-25), China has been promoting green development to realize carbon neutrality by 2060.In 2021, China's crude steel output was 1.03 billion tons, down 3 percent from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed in January. It was the first year-on-year decline since 2016.According to a plan released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, by 2025, China will build a number of super-sized steel conglomerates, and the top 10 steel enterprises will account for 60 percent of the country's steel output.In August last year, China's two major steelmakers - Ansteel and Ben Gang Group Corp - signed a deal to merge, creating the world's third-largest steelmaker. After the merger, Ansteel had an annual production capacity of 63 million tons of crude steel, ranking third in the world.Global Times
