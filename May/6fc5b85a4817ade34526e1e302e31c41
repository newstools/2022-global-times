In order to receive and treat these patients as soon as possible, we designate them to different facilities according to the severity of their disease: mildly ill patients and asymptomatic virus carriers could be sent to support hospitals, and the others transferred to designated hospitals, which would help avoid overload of medical resources, according to Guo. These permanent support hospitals will be used as fundamental facilities and can be set to receive patients in 24 hours once an outbreak occurs, according to Guo.Under the situation of normalized epidemic prevention and control, preparing a certain number of support hospitals can rapidly expand the number of beds in the shortest time and reduce the occupation of normal medical resources, Guo said.On the other hand, it can ensure every patient is treated in a very short period of time and can also coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and normal medical services, which not only ensures the treatment of the novel coronavirus, but also guarantees the supply of normal medical services for our people, Guo noted.Ma unveiled the emphasis and blueprint to curb the virus in the long run, including building permanent support facilities, in an article published in the Communist Party of China Central Committee's flagship magazine, Qiushi Journal, on May 16.He noted that "if China did not put efforts and resources into preventive measures, the country would face a large number of infections, huge pressure on treatment and risks to the lives of vulnerable people, including patients with underlying conditions, the elderly, children and pregnant women. The development of the economy and society would also be seriously affected. This is something the Chinese people and the Chinese government will never allow to happen."
