The inspection on illegal items such as guns, explosives and knifes will also be raised.The MPS also stressed rapid response in the face of emergency. Severe punishment and focus will be given to crimes related to women, children, students and other vulnerable groups. The 100-day national campaign aiming at cracking down on illegal behaviors was launched on June 25 in the wake of the restaurant assault in Tangshan, North China's Hebei Province. Last week, the Hebei provincial public security department announced its phased results of the 100-day campaign, saying 307 illegal cases were detected, 558 suspects and 135 criminals who were previously at large were arrested.A series of grievous incidents like the one that occurred in Tangshan angered the public when they happened against the background of a national campaign to crack down on gang crimes.On Monday, the Supreme People's Procuratorate reaffirmed the determination to wipe out all gang-related crime. In conclusion, through the three-year national campaign to crackdown on gang crimes from 2018 to 2021, the SPP said China has indicted 230,000 people who were engaged in mafia-like gangs and other crimes, and 2,987 people who acted as their protectors. Global Times
