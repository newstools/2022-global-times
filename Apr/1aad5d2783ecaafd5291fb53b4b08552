The corporate income tax will be further reduced by half for SMEs which have an annual taxable income of more than 1 million yuan ($157,200) but less than 3 million yuan.Pang Wei, an official from the local tax authority said at a press briefing that more than one million enterprises will be able to receive support from the measures. East China's Jiangxi Province also issued a variety of tax reduction policies to support local businesses on Wednesday. Taxpayers who have genuine difficulties in paying property tax and tax on urban land use and who meet the conditions will be granted exemptions in 2022 in accordance with the regulations.
