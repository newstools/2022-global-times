I have asthma, so I have to stay inside to protect my lungs," he said.Iraq, Iran, Syria and other Gulf states are no strangers to sand and dust storms which have historically ­occurred in the hot months from May to July when strong northwesterly winds carry large amounts of dust throughout parts of the region.But these days the storms are ­coming earlier and more frequently, rising well above the once-normal once or twice a year, starting as early as March and spreading over a wider area.
