Our working conditions are atrocious and patients are suffering because of it," said Ronan Treguer, a child psychiatric nurse in Nantes."I love my profession, but it's hard to stay motivated because we can't do it properly anymore," said Nathalie Niort, a nurse demonstrating outside the hospital in Clermont-Ferrand.Casualty workers' group Samu-Urgences de France found in a May survey that at least 120 accident and emergency departments nationwide had already cut back on work or were preparing to do so after years of COVID-19 strain.AFP
