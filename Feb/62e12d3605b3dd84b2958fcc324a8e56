For example, the navy received the first Type 054A/P frigate, and the army acquired the HQ-9/P air defense missile system, according to media reports."This demonstrates that defense cooperation between China and Pakistan is going even wider and deeper, and the large-scale adaptation of Chinese equipment by all Pakistani military services will significantly boost their combat capabilities," Shi said, noting that a simple system with most Chinese hardware can also be supply chain friendly.To China, the first successful sale of the J-10 series fighter and the WS-10 series engine will further open the international market and more countries will show serious interests in Chinese aviation equipment, analysts said."Pakistan's procurement of the J-10C is also meaningful for China and Pakistan as a more powerful Pakistan military can better safeguard the shared interests of the two countries in the region," Shi said.During the induction ceremony of the first Type 054A/P frigate in January, the President of Pakistan, Dr Arif Alvi, said that the ship will help to safeguard the sea routes of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
