It provides a dataset every 6 minutes for the meteorological department.The automatic meteorological station also monitors around the clock data including wind speed, direction as well as temperature and humidity.According to Huang, the largest drop in elevation is about 1,000 meters in Yanqing's National Alpine Skiing Centre. If athletes encounter strong gales, not only will their performance be affected, they may find it hard to control their bodies, which could lead to serious injuries. For example, the men's downhill at the Winter Olympics, which was originally set at 11 am on Sunday, was postponed to Monday at noon due to unsafe high winds. During the delay, the weather forecast team studied the changes in wind speeds hour by hour, and reported these weather conditions promptly.Such great meteorological services and good weather conditions ensured the successful holding of the delayed event. According to Huang, race director Markus Waldner spoke highly of the professional and precise meteorological services in the Yanqing competition zone.
