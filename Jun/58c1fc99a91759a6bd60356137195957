In the first five months of the year, the country's actual use of foreign investment rose by 17.3 percent year-on-year to 564.2 billion yuan, or rather, it gained 22.6 percent in US dollar terms year-on-year to $87.77 billion, per data from the Ministry of Commerce. A breakdown of the numbers showed that South Korea's actual investment in China soared 52.8 percent, while that from the US jumped 27.1 percent and German investment in China grew by 21.4 percent.The stellar growth figures point to a conspicuous uptrend in foreign commitments to China, especially for foreign businesses that have competitive edges, Tian said.As for a relocation of some foreign firms into Southeast Asia, that's mostly about such businesses losing steam in competitiveness in the Chinese market, which prompts them to shift to other markets seeking lower costs, the economist noted.
