It will also attract other Taiwan residents willing to hitch a ride on the mainland's rapid development, said analysts.As of the end of 2021, there were 359 self-employed Taiwan farmers and 9,926 self-employed Taiwan residents registered in the mainland, according to statistics from the market regulator."The policy of sharing development opportunities with Taiwan compatriots will not change. We welcome our compatriots in Taiwan to seize the opportunity and come to the mainland for greater and better development," said Zhu.She added that more opportunities and choices will be provided for Taiwan compatriots, especially those from the grassroots level and young people who want to start businesses and realize their dreams in the mainland.In 2007, 2011 and 2015, relevant departments issued a total of three documents regarding Taiwan residents who were applying to set up self-employed businesses in the mainland."The mainland is willing to offer opportunities to Taiwan residents, but it is up to individuals to seize them," said an analyst.
