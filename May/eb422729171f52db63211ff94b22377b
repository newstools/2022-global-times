Zhao Lijian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson at a press conferenceThe US' designation of the "special coordinator for Tibetan issues" interferes in China's internal affairs, Zhao Lijian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a press conference on Thursday, noting that the Chinese government firmly opposes it and will never recognize such interference, and that any Xizang-related affair is purely China's internal affair and allows no interference by any foreign country.Uzra Zeya, US Undersecretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights and "special coordinator for Tibetan issues", is set to meet with the Dalai Lama and members of the so-called "Tibetan government-in-exile" on Thursday during a two-day visit to Dharamsala, India, according to media reports.The so-called "Tibetan government-in-exile" is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organization completely in violation of China's Constitution and laws. It is not recognized by any country in the world, Zhao said.Zhao added that the 14th Dalai Lama is a political exile under the cloak of religion, who has long been engaged in anti-China separatist activities and plots to separate Xizang from China.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken previously said Zeya would seek to "promote dialogue" between China and the Dalai Lama."We urge the US to abide by its commitment of recognizing Xizang as part of China and not supporting Xizang separatists, and to stop using Xizang-related issues to meddle in China's domestic affairs," said Zhao Lijian, noting that China will continue to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.Global Times
