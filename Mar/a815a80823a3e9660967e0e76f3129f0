File Photo:VCGEntertainers should be self-disciplined and take the responsibility for guiding their fans, as some political advisors suggested during the ongoing two sessions, following concerns about chaos in the Chinese entertainment industry like unreasonably high income of some entertainers, tax evasion and fans' irrational worship of idols.The problems in the entertainment industry continue to be on the spotlight at the ongoing annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.Feng Yuanzheng and Gong Hanlin, both experienced Chinese actors and members of the CPPCC, put forward suggestions to rectify these issues in the entertainment industry."Entertainers need to have a moral baseline for themselves, or they cannot guide their followers correctly," Feng said, emphasizing the importance of the role of entertainers in regulating fans.Feng highlighted the importance of moral values of entertainers and called on giving young artists more opportunities to create brilliant works of art based on the right views and values.Gong mentioned the unreasonably high incomes and tax scandals of some celebrities, saying that they can earn tens of millions yuan but still cheat on taxes, like the cases of Chinese actress Fan Bingbing and Zheng Shuang which shocked the whole country.Gong also referred to soccer players who have high incomes but do not perform well on the field. He suggested a reform of the system of commendation for model workers to let everyone see that they are valuable.The problems referred by the advisors have been in consideration and rectification by the Chinese government since 2021.  The Cyberspace Administration of China published a notice in August 2021 on its website asking provincial offices for more efforts to rectify the chaos on fan groups. The administration specified 10 measures, including cancelling all rankings for entertainers, banning forums that pick fights and lead to chaos and requesting agencies to better guide fan groups.
