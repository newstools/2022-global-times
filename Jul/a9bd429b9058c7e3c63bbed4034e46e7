Since unrest in Myanmar broke out in February 2021, Western public opinion has been magnifying every smallest development as to China-Myanmar economic and trade cooperation, out of the sinister purposes of not only sowing discord between the two countries by inciting hatred toward China in local communities but also creating antagonism in the region.While the US and its allies have imposed sanctions against Myanmar, they have no reason to expect China and ASEAN to follow their lead in the name of "ideological values." In fact, far from achieving their goals, the sanctions imposed by the US and its European allies have caused a serious humanitarian disaster for the Myanmar people.It is known to all that China has long pursued a policy of non-interference in Myanmar's internal affairs. So any economic and trade cooperation between the two countries should by no means be politicized as China's stance. As Myanmar's largest trading partner and largest source of foreign direct investment, China has been offering consistent assistance to the neighbor's economic development.Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, China has been actively cooperating with Myanmar in the fight against the virus, providing 51 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Myanmar to date, according to the Chinese embassy in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. China has also helped Myanmar with filling and producing vaccines, and the vaccines produced under the cooperation of the two sides have already been put into use for vaccination, according to media reports.In a recent meeting with Myanmar's Foreign Minister U Wunna Maung Lwin, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China is willing to promote practical cooperation with Myanmar through increased imports of its quality agricultural products, expansion of bilateral financial cooperation, implementation of poverty reduction projects and more direct flights for local students to return to China to resume their studies. The two officials also agreed to speed up the construction of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and implement the cross-border power grid agreement. On Sunday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged China and ASEAN to put pressure on Myanmar, Reuters reported. This is apparently not the right way to address the problem in Myanmar, which may only create confrontation and conflict over the country across the region.Economic growth is the most effective way to pull people out of poverty and deliver on their wider objectives for a better life. China will not follow the baton of US sanctions, but will promote economic and trade relations with Myanmar in the interests of peaceful development of the whole region.
