In comparison, 4 trillion yuan is equal to or more than the GDPs of more than 20 countries and regions, including Thailand, Belgium and Austria.In 2021, China's per capita disposable income hit 35,128 yuan, growing 8.1 percent year-on-year after adjustment for inflation, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. Rising disposable income is essential to several key areas of priority for top policymakers, including people's livelihood, consumption and the overall economic development, as consumer spending is directly connected to changes in disposable income. Eight provincial-level regions, including Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Tianjin, recorded per capita disposable incomes above the national level.The income growth rates in western China were generally higher than those along the east coast. Data from the NBS showed that per capita disposable incomes in western China increased by 9.4 percent. That was 0.3, 0.2 and 1.4 percentage points faster than in eastern, central and northeastern China, respectively. Fang Xiaodan, an official from the NBS said that the figures reflected a narrowing income gap between the western parts of the country and the traditional economic hubs in the east and south.In 2021, the per capita disposable income of rural residents stood at 18,931 yuan, up 9.7 percent, while the per capita disposable income of urban residents reached 47,412 yuan, up 7.1 percent, also reflecting a narrowing divide.Global Times
