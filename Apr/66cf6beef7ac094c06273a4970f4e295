There was drama right until the midnight deadline ordered by the Supreme Court, with the speaker of the assembly - a Khan loyalist - resigning at the last minute.?In the end, the session continued through to Sunday with a replacement."We will put a balm on the wounds of this nation," Sharif said immediately after the result was announced.Whoever takes over will still have to deal with the issues that bedevilled Khan: soaring inflation, a feeble rupee and crippling debt.Militancy is also on the rise, with Pakistan's Taliban emboldened by the return to power of the hard-line Islamist group in neighboring Afghanistan in 2022.Tempers rose in the assembly when Sharif insisted a vote be held immediately - as ordered by the Supreme Court on Thursday - but Khan Loyalists demanded discussion first on their leader's claims that there had been foreign interference in the process.Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi accused the opposition of leading the country down a dangerous path."History will expose all those, who set the stage for this move to topple the government," he said, to chants of "vote, vote" from the opposition.Khan insists he has been the victim of a "regime change" conspiracy involving the United States.He said the PML-N and the Pakistan Peoples Party had conspired with Washington to bring the no-confidence vote because of his opposition to US foreign policy, particularly in Muslim nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.How long the next government lasts is also a matter of speculation.
