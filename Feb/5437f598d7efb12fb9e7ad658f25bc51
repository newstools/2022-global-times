Beijing 2022 opening ceremony Photo:Li Hao/GTUS biathlete Leif Nordgren watched his wife give birth to their first child via video call from the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics the day before his first race, after being apart from her since mid-November.His wife's due date was initially February 4, the day of the opening ceremony. "That was really cool," 32-year-old Nordgren said of watching the birth of his daughter.His wife Caitlin Nordgren, a meteorologist for NBC, told the US broadcaster before she gave birth that the couple had realized as soon as she was pregnant that it was "not good timing for us."But she said there was "a silver lining" because her husband's presence inside the strict Covid-19 bubble surrounding the Olympics meant she could easily get hold of him."Therefore, he will be a little bit more available to answer my phone calls and things like that," she said.
