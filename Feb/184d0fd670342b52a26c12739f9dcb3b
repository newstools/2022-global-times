Chinese producers in East China's Zhejiang Province are seeing surging orders from both overseas and home. "We have been seeing a rapid order increase," a salesperson from Maosen Sports Equipment located in Ningbo, Zhejiang, told the Global Times on Saturday.Maosen mainly manufactures snow boards, with most of its products being exported to North America and Europe, the salesperson introduced.Apart from increased exports, the factory's orders placed by domestic buyers have also gone up in recent years, she said.Liming Metalware Co from Ningbo recorded a 50-percent order increase from overseas. The firm mainly produces ski poles and ski shoes, local Zhejiang Satellite TV reported on Tuesday.In the fourth quarter of 2021, Ningbo producers exported ski gear and equipment worth of 196 million yuan ($31 million), a surge of 56.3 percent year-on-year. The export category mainly involves ski clothing and ski shoes and boots, which are mainly sold to North America and Europe, China Central television CCTV reported on Saturday, citing a local customs official.With China achieving its goal of engaging 300 million people in winter sports prior to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, a huge market has formed up which will greatly boost the development of China's winter sports manufacturing industries, Jiang Yiyi, deputy head of the School of Leisure Sports and Tourism under the Beijing Sport University, told the Global Times on Saturday.Besides the surging orders, the Winter Olympics will profoundly promote the development of winter sports manufacturing in the long run, according to Jiang.Foreign makers, particularly from traditional winter sports leading power states, have been leading the equipment industries, Jiang said, stressing that Chinese producers are now gaining advantages with a surging domestic demand and the nation's research and development (R&D) of new materials.A number of high-tech industrial parks have been set up focusing on winter sports-related industries, and firms and universities have joined hands seeking new technology R&D. All these investment, adding with China's world-class manufacturing capacity, will further drive the rapid growth of China's winter sports manufacturing, Jiang noted.Global Times
