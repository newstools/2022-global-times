The target was 17 and 10 percent respectively.  OECMs were formally defined in 2018 and are "already making a huge difference" in the statistics, said Heather Bingham, who leads the Protected Planet initiative. But she said in the future the measurement of success must go beyond just the size and location of conserved territory."It's a big challenge. We have a good sense of where protected areas are but we don't have a good sense of how well they are performing," she said.New monitoring methods could include technology like satellites, as well as more robust local reporting.  Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy said there needs to be a "sniff test": "We have to see that biodiversity is maintained and/or improving." And a 30 percent target must not distract from efforts to nurture biodiversity everywhere, she said, from increasing green spaces in cities to cutting pesticide use in agriculture. "We need 100 percent really. We've already lost too much nature," Krueger said.AFP
