But the environment minister soon appealed that watershed ruling.On Tuesday, Australia's federal court sided with the minister, in part because of the "tiny increase in risk" from the coal mine at the center of the case - Whitehaven's Vickery coal mine.Anjali Sharma, 17, said the ruling had left her and her fellow students "devastated.""Two years ago, Australia was on fire; today, it's underwater. Burning coal makes bushfires and floods more catastrophic and more deadly. Something needs to change," she said.Izzy Raj-Seppings, 15, said there was "still much to celebrate" in the judgement."The court accepted that young people will bear the brunt of the impacts of the climate crisis," she said, arguing that is an important step in climate litigation.The students' lawyers will consider whether to appeal the case to Australia's highest court.The Australian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.AFP
