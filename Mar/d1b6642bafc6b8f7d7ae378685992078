The US should immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies. China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies," Reuters reported."For Chinese firms, being included on the list has a limited impact due to the tiny business scale," Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, an industry association, told the Global Times on Saturday.In business terms, US' decoupling move, which has the tendency of upgrading, will finally hurt its own telecom industry, and the gap between China and the US particularly in the 5G era is likely to widen, Xiang said, noting that such US practice will also harm its own business environment due to the lack of trust and credit.The FCC decided on March 16 to revoke the right of Chinese telecom company Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC to provide relevant telecom services in the US.China's top industry regulator, ̶ the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), ̶ on Thursday urged the US to withdraw its decisions against the two Chinese telecom companies, stop politicizing economic issues, and create a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies to invest and develop in the US.The move has severely damaged the business environment in the US, harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and consumers around the world, including US users, the MIIT said.Previously, the FCC revoked the licenses of China Telecom Americas and China Unicom (Americas) Operations to provide relevant telecom services in the US. Both firms had been operating in the US for about two decades before their licenses were revoked.The regulator designated five Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE Corp, Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Dahua Technology Co in March 2021.FCC said it "will continue to update the list as other communications equipment and services meet the criteria under the law." Global Times
