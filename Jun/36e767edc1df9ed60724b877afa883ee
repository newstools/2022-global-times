Zhao Lijian Photo: VCGTaiwan island officials attempted to sneak into the United Nations Ocean Conference on Monday by hiding in the Tuvalu delegation but failed. Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at Wednesday's media briefing that stooping to join the entourage of a foreign country in order to tag along and wedge into the United Nations Ocean Conference only brings disgrace to themselves.He said China follows true multilateralism and supports the parties in participating in the UN Ocean Conference in line with relevant laws and rules, and that China would be glad to see relevant parties correct their mistakes and return to the conference to focus on sustainable marine development. Some countries have ignored the one-China principle, provided convenience for Taiwan authorities to attend the meeting and deliberately hyped it up, which China is firmly opposed to, Zhao said. There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China. The one-China principle is a basic norm of international relations and shared consensus of the international community. It is also a basic principle affirmed in UNGA Resolution 2758, Zhao said. Zhao made the remarks in response to Taiwan authorities' failed attempt to sneak into the United Nations Ocean Conference. Reuters reported that the foreign minister of Tuvalu decided to pull out of a United Nations oceans conference in Portugal on Monday after three Taiwan officials on the pacific islands' delegation had their accreditations blocked. Global Times
