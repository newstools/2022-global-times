Among 80 special research projects affiliated with the key project, 212 technologies were eventually applied, providing strong support for the "simple, safe and wonderful" Olympics, said Huang Jing, director of the Administrative Center for China's Agenda 21. Agenda 21 is a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development.The high-tech firstly guarantees epidemic control of the Winter Olympics. More than 150 bioaerosol COVID-19 monitoring systems have been deployed, which can detect the air at all points in the venue. The system has detection sensitivity three times higher than traditional detection methods, and more than 30,000 sets of sensing devices were equipped to timely detect and report abnormal physical conditions of the service and support personnel, Xu Qiang from Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission said. The visual technologies such as 8K stereo broadcasting system provide good visual experience for those watching the competitions on the screen. "Green" is also one of the themes for the "high-tech Winter Games": the torch is made of carbon-fiber materials which is light and resistant to high temperatures, and is fueled by hydrogen; the eco-friendly ice rinks use the world's largest trans-critical CO2 direct cooling system which improves the energy efficiency by more than 20 percent; and the ice surface temperature difference is limited to 0.5 C. The hydrogen-powered buses deployed in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou, and the biodegradable tableware being used at the Games which are made from raw materials like straw and corn, are also eco-friendly and use the high technology.Behind all the high technology in this Winter Olympics is a display of Beijing's scientific and technological innovation. Not only scientific research institutions, but also a large number of enterprises in fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and new materials actively participated in the Games. "While we celebrate the athletes, we also celebrate the advances in technology that connect us and make our lives better," Xu said. Global Times
