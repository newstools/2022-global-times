The New York Philharmonic. File photo: CFPOne of the world's oldest symphony orchestras, the New York Philharmonic, has performed a symphony composed by a young Chinese girl. The symphony is intended to mark the centenary of US women's constitutional suffrage.A 13-year-old girl from Shanghai named Wendy Wen and her creation Lady Liberty in a Thunderstorm, was played by the orchestra in New York on Saturday as part of the Young People's Concert: Youth as Creator.The concert was held to recognize the outstanding creative abilities of children, and it has been delayed by nearly two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Saturday also saw the New York Philharmonic Orchestra perform works by talented young composers from the US, Finland and Israel.The connection between Wen and the New York Philharmonic originated from a cross-border music workshop project called Young Composer, which was jointly planned by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic.The project was initiated by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1995 and in 2016 the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra joined the project.Since then the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra has been selecting 10 young composers to participate in a one-week workshop every summer, aiming to awaken children's musical imagination through interesting games and meetings with artists."Composing music is a way to record life that enables self expression. I realize that music is actually everywhere," young Wen told the Global Times after the concert. "I feel like this workshop is a stepping stone for me toward a composing career and I really appreciate it."Born in 2008, Wen comes from a musical family, as her father Wen Deqing is also a composer. She began to learn composing from her father two years ago."My father used to take me to concerts in Shanghai every year. And I think my father's works are also unique and interesting. Every year I develop my interest in music and I want to be as good a composer as my father," Wen told the Global Times.In 2019, commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, Wen composed the orchestral piece Lady Liberty in a Thunderstorm to commemorate the centenary of constitutional suffrage of women in the US."The Statue of Liberty has been standing in the US since 1886, but it wasn't until 1920 that women got the right to vote. I hope to express my feelings through music to recognize their perseverance, pursuit of freedom and rights, and determination to break through constraints," said Wen.Global Times
