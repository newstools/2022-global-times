He called on Party cadres to be courageous to face the problems squarely and muster the resolve to "wield the knife" and "cut off all tumors."Acknowledging that the campaign has built into a crushing tide and is being consolidated, Xi however warned of the complexity and difficulty of the anti-graft situation, urging more efforts to see the fight through.Xi underlined the Party's centralized and unified leadership over the anti-corruption fight and called for coordinated progress in the fight in all sectors.He also emphasized maintaining zero-toleration and eliminating sectoral and systematic corruption which pose higher risks to effectively defuse relevant economic and social risks.Xi urged regular and long-term mechanisms against corruption, and coordination between precaution and punishment to improve the ability to detect and effectively handle corruption issues.The improvement of anti-corruption laws and regulations relating to foreign affairs should also be accelerated, Xi said.Sending precaution to senior officials, Xi said cadres in higher positions and with greater power must exercise stricter self-discipline.Xi said members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in particular must hold themselves to the highest standards of self-discipline, and take the lead among all Party members in following the Party's dos and don'ts.
