Migrants from Latin America in a caravan toward the border with the US arrive in Huixtla, Mexico, on June 7, 2022. US Vice President Kamala Harris announced another $1.9 billion in private-sector funding to boost jobs in hope of reducing migration from Central America, at a summit in Los Angeles snubbed by the leaders of Mexico and other affected countries.
