Before his trip to Iran, al-Kadhimi had visited Saudi Arabia, where he was welcomed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.During his trip, al-Kadhimi would discuss the diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia with the leaders of the two countries, according to Iraqi media.To improve bilateral relations and ease regional tension, Baghdad hosted four rounds of direct talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia last year, and the fifth round was held in April.Xinhua
