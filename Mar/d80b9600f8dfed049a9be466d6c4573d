"Four of the gunmen were neutralised and five IED [improvised explosive devices] were recovered."Abattam said Saturday that a number of gunmen armed with explosives attacked Umuguma police station outside Owerri, the state capital, leaving two police constables dead.He said some gunmen also invaded the residence of George Obiozor, leader of Ohanaeze, the Igbo cultural union, and destroyed part of the building with explosives. Obiozor was not at home at the time of the attack, he said.Southeast Nigeria has seen a surge in violence, with more than 130 police and other security personnel killed by gunmen since 2021, according to local media tallies.Authorities have blamed attacks on either the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (POB) movement, which is campaigning for a separate state for the ethnic Igbo people, or its armed wing, known as ESN.AFP
