It is also said to be the world's most functional snowboard waxing vehicle, as it can work in many areas, including during athletes' warm-ups, storage, shower rooms, toilets and elevators for disabled athletes.Snowboards of skiing athletes need to be waxed in order to ensure speed when they are racing. The vehicle is a mobile waxing workshop that can be deployed at any location to support athletes during training or formal games.Though it made its debut at the Winter Games, the vehicle has been used by China's skiing team for a while. Developed by a research group initiated by East China's Shandong Province government and combined with multiple local departments and sports equipment providers, the vehicle was officially handed over to the Chinese national skiing team at the end of October 2021. Then it was quickly put into use in the training program of the Chinese national cross-country skiing team in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions.It also participated in the national skiing team's training program in North China's Hebei Province and in Shanghai before the Beijing 2022 games, said the manufacturer. The head of the developing team for the vehicle told the Global Times on Monday that the machine has traveled 15,000 kilometers.In another key technological achievement, the vehicle's heating system can maintain the inner temperature of the vehicle between 15-25 C even if the outside temperature falls down to -50 C. Global Times
