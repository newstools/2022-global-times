The case is reportedly very complicated involving a good number of people, according to an official note released on Saturday.Since April 18, clients of the above mentioned four rural banks in Henan and one in neighboring Anhui Province found that they could not withdraw their cash. Subsequently, some of the clients complained that their digital health codes which tracks people’s travel and COVID nucleic acid test information, turned red, including some clients who didn’t visit Henan.In order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, most of the public places and public transportation in Chinese cities require people to present a green health code, taken within 48-72 hours.The irregularity quickly sparked criticism on social media platforms, with netizens questioning that the health code system was illegally hijacked in Henan by the unruly to prevent the banks’ clients from visiting Henan. The local commission for discipline inspection in Henan’s capital city Zhengzhou announced Friday the initiation of an investigation and accountability procedures against the unruly.According to an investigation by domestic economic news site Yicai.com, the actual controller of Henan New Wealth Group is named Lv Yi. Through his hundreds of companies across the country – many of which are shell companies, Lv has controlled multiple domestic urban and rural small lenders. The group was suspected of illegal using third-party platforms to absorb public funds.
