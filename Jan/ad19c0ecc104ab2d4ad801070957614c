In a breakdown, snow and ice equipment recorded a turnover growth of 107 percent year-on-year, while snow sports clothing booked a 99 percent rise and ski protection gear reported a 41 percent increase. In another sign of unprecedented craving for snow and ice experiences, there have been plans among young travelers to spend multiple days, or a big part of their Spring Festival holidays, in ski resorts, according to a statement domestic online travel platform Lvmama sent to the Global Times.The Badaling Ski Resort, about 2 kilometers on the west of the Beijing Badaling Great Wall, is among the top picks for a ski-powered Spring Festival experience.The Winter Olympics "stokes the snow tourism fire and allows for travelers to feel the charisma of winter sports," said Zou Qingling, chief executive of Lvmama.The grassroots-level enthusiasm apparently echoes the winter sports avidness of the country's top leader.Chinese President Xi Jinping championed China's efforts to win the bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Xi, himself a keen winter sports fan, is also encouraging hundreds of millions of Chinese to be involved in ice and snow sports.By 2025, the country's ice and snow sports are expected to become a way more prevailing activity, with the population taking a direct part in winter sports including athletes, coaches and referees topping 50 million, per the country's winter sports development plan (2016-25) unveiled by the National Development and Reform Commission, the General Administration of Sport of China, among other government departments. The country has also set a goal to engage 300 million people in winter sports.

Compared with the development of winter sports in Western countries, China is still at the initial stage as the public's enthusiasm has been sparked but a lack of systematic and scientific knowledge on winter sports exists.China's skiers account for merely 1 percent of the Chinese population in 2019, far below countries with a head start such as Switzerland, which boasts a 35 percent penetration rate, according to Chen Mengjie, chief strategist with Yuekai Securities in Beijing, speaking of the vast untapped opportunities in the Winter Games' wake.In the words of Zhou, the Beijing Games are envisaged to become a chance for China to populate and promote skiing, scientific sports, sports medicine and other related fields to bolster Chinese people's health and train more professional talents to carry on and promote the sports."I hope more people in China can come to join the winter sports and to feel the thrill and fun of the sports safely and get the experience of pushing themselves and making breakthroughs in the sports!" President Xi, who has attached great importance to the development of sports in the country, has on many occasions expounded on his understanding of sports and laid down principles for the cause."Once a country that had few chances to participate in the Olympic Games, China today is home to athletes who excel at many sports. This markedly manifests China's development and growth of national strength," Xi said, according to Xinhua. Sports play an irreplaceable role in improving people's fitness and health, facilitating well-rounded human development, enriching people's intellectual and cultural life, promoting economic and social development, and galvanizing the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to promote the spirit of striving for excellence and outperforming themselves, according to Xi.
