After completing its mission and separating from the space station, the cargo spacecraft will not directly return to the ground, but will instead return to a predetermined sea area along with the waste, enter the atmosphere, and then get burned off, Yang Hong, chief designer of China's space station, told the media previously.Tianzhou-2's predecessor - China's first resupply craft for the country's Tiangong-2 space lab mission - detached from the lab on June 21, 2017. After two braking maneuvers under the precise control and close monitoring of ground controllers, it plunged into the Earth's atmosphere and burned up on September 22, 2017.China plans to complete construction of its first space station this year, and the Tianzhou-4 cargo spaceship, the Shenzhou-14 manned craft, two experimental modules, the Tianzhou-5 cargo spaceship, and the Shenzhou-15 manned craft will be rolled out in sequence, according to mission plans.
