Potential migrants stand on the Moroccan side of the fence that separates the Spanish enclave from Morocco, in Fnideq, Morocco, on May 18, 2021. The Spanish enclave of Ceuta is having to deal with an influx of immigrants after an estimated 6,000 people have entered the territory from Morocco, according to the central government's delegation in the city.
