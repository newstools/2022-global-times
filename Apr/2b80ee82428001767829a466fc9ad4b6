Around 25,000 beneficiaries received a payment from the General Settlement Fund," the statement said. The fund was set up to study requests for the return of property acquired legally after the war by local authorities or the Austrian state following the Nazis' plundering from Jewish people during the country's annexation to the Third Reich. More than 2,300 applications were submitted and 140 met the criteria, the fund said in a statement. Austria, which became a prosperous country in the years following World War II, took the historic decision to set up a fund to compensate victims of Nazism after decades of denial.It has been the subject of legal action by survivors and their descendants in the US, who have accused individuals and communities of taking advantage of the plundering to get rich with impunity. AFP
