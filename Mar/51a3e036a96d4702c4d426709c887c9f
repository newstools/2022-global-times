The specimen is close to the northern hawk owl,  a medium-sized owl of the northern latitudes, non-migratory and diurnal. The extinct owl belongs to clade Surniini which contains most living diurnal owl species.A comparison of sclera bones of the Miocene owl and 55 reptiles and 360 birds, including many owls, showed the ancient bird's eyes are less open to light and enable it to see things clear during the day, according to a statement by the institute.

The discovery was published on Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) on Monday. Phylogenetically constrained character mapping coincides with a reconstruction of the owl group's early evolutionary reversal away from nocturnal habits. The findings support a potential Miocene origin of nonnocturnal habits in a globally distributed owl group, which may be linked to steppe habitat expansion and climatic cooling in the late Miocene, according to the study. The fossil and associated analyses of the eye and behavioral evolution also point to a long evolutionary history of nonnocturnal behavior among owls that has yet to be studied in detail.
