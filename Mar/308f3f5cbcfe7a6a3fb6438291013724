Wang Wenbin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Photo: fmprc.gov.cn China’s Foreign Ministry said Japan’s wartime sexual slavery and forced labor crimes cannot be falsified or whitewashed in newly approved high school textbooks, and its futile claim to the Diaoyu Islands won’t change the territory’s Chinese ownership.Japan’s Education Ministry on Tuesday approved the changing of the phrase “wartime comfort women” into “comfort women,” and “forced mobilization of labor” into “mobilization of labor” in high school textbooks, TBS News reported.  When asked for comments, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday that Japan’s forced mobilization of comfort women and labor during its invasion is a historical fact recognized by the international community and can never be covered up.Wang pointed out that blurring historical facts through playing word tricks to understate and evade guilt has long been a customary tactic by Japan.South Korea’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday also accused Japan of whitewashing wartime atrocities in which women were forced into sexual slavery and people were forcefully conscripted. Kyodo News reported that the Diaoyu Islands are claimed as “Japan’s inherent territory” in the newly approved textbooks. But Wang emphasized that any attempt to damage China’s territorial sovereignty would be in vain. “China possesses indisputable sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islands, which cannot be changed by any of Japan’s petty actions in textbooks,” Wang said. With strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition, China has made solemn representations to the Japanese side, said the spokesperson, while also urging Japan to properly deal with its historical legacy and avoid further loss of trust among neighboring Asian countries and the international community.
