Kennedy Jr, who compared vaccine mandates to the Holocaust, took to the microphone in front of the white marble Lincoln Memorial to decry the rules.Like other COVID-19 restrictions aimed at reining in a disease that has infected more than 70 million people in the US, killed more than 865,000 and brought much of daily life around the globe to a stuttering halt for two years and counting, vaccine mandates have become a deeply polarizing political issue."Breathe. Inhale God, exhale fear," exhorted yet another to applause from the crowd, made up of people of all ages, including children, and largely unmasked."I'm not anti-vaccine, but I'm anti this vaccine," Michelle, a 61-year-old physical therapist from Virginia who declined to give her last name, told AFP. She said the messenger RNA serums developed by companies such as Pfizer and Moderna in record time were "too experimental" and "rushed."AFP
