But facts will speak for themselves; rumors and falsehoods will fail, Wang told Bachelet.Wang said he hopes Bachelet's visit to China will make her better understand China's development ideas, routes and achievements, and the progress China has made on human rights.Bachelet will embark on her planned trip to the country's northwestern Xinjiang region.Wang introduced China's development journey and the governance beliefs of the Communist Party of China based on the 5,000 years of the country's civilized tradition, highlighting the CPC always puts the people at the center and places people's yearning for a better life as its goal.China has always given top priority to ensuring that legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens including ethnic minorities are protected, Wang said.Several data are highlighted.China feeds one-fifth of the world's population on less than 9 percent of the world's land. It's also built the world's largest social insurance healthcare network.China resolved the issue of absolute poverty, achieved the poverty reduction target set by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule, and brought more than 1.4 billion Chinese people into a moderately prosperous society in all respects.China is the only major country in the world that has continuously formulated and implemented the four phases of national human rights action plans; rights of all ethnic groups to manage state affairs on an equal footing are legally guaranteed, and development of regions where ethnic groups are living are supported by various methods.

Multilateral human rights institution should become a stage for cooperation and dialogue, rather than a new battlefield for division and confrontation.In their talk, Bachelet congratulated the achievements that China has made in economic development and human rights protection, and spoke highly of China's positive role in supporting multilateralism, development fundraising and sustainable development.Bachelet said the OHCHR attaches great importance to China's role in human rights and hopes the visit could enhance mutual understanding and trust so as to respond to global challenges and boost international human rights development together.The news of Bachelet's visit to China has attracted wide attention, as anti-China forces in the US and some Western countries ramped up efforts to hype the groundless "genocide" accusations about China's Xinjiang region, which have been refuted multiple times by China.Global Times
