An autopsy has been carried out in Spain on former Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who died last week in Barcelona, at the request of one of his daughters who suspects foul play, her lawyers said Monday.The results of the autopsy are not yet available, a spokesperson for Tchize dos Santos' lawyers said.A Barcelona court authorized the post-mortem on Friday, the day of his death, a court spokesperson said.Dos Santos had lived in Barcelona since April 2019.The 79-year-old was taken to hospital and placed in intensive care after suffering a cardiac arrest on June 23. His 44-year-old daughter - whose full name is Welwitschia dos Santos - swiftly demanded the hospital retain his body "until an appropriate autopsy is carried out."She said in a statement on Saturday there were "a series of signs" that her ­father's death occurred under "suspicious circumstances."Tchize has filed a legal case in Spain against the former Angolan president's widow, Ana Paula, and his personal physician for "attempted murder."The complaint also includes allegations relating to "failure to exercise a duty of care, injury resulting from gross negligence and disclosure of secrets by people close to him," her lawyers said in a statement on Friday.Tchize claimed her father and his wife had been separated for some time, meaning that his spouse had no right to make decisions about his health. Police confirmed receiving the complaint and said they had opened an inquiry. Born in the slums of Luanda, Dos Santos was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. He came to power in September 1979, following the death of Antonio Agostinho Neto, the first president of Angola. He served as president of the Republic of Angola for 38 years until September 2017, when he was ­succeeded by the current Head of State, Joao Lourenco.
