Total output of major chemicals rose 5.7 percent year-on-year, according to data released by the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF) in February.Refined oil consumption increased by 3.2 percent year-on-year in 2021 to reach 341.48 million tons, official data showed.China's dependence on oil imports dropped for the first time in the past two decades in 2021, from 73.6 percent in 2020 to 72 percent in 2021, said the CPCIF.
