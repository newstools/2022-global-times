Coal ships berth at the wharf at a power plant in Yangzhou, East China's Jiangsu Province. The 1,000-year-old Grand Canal has become a key transportation artery for vessels loaded with coal in central China to sail south to allow coal-fired plants there to generate more electricity as power demand soars in bitter winter weather.

The local government is issuing passes to facilitate coal shipments from ports for inter-provincial transportation, Hou said. Also, the heating season is about to end.There is also not much demand for coking coal from the steel industry, because infrastructure projects are also being affected by the epidemic, so there's little pressure from that source either, Hou said.
