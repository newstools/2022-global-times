In Brooklyn, white crosses were erected for the children killed in Uvalde and portraits of those killed in Buffalo fastened to shopping carts. Ease of access to firearms, and mental health problems that can lead to them being used in attacks, have both been in the spotlight in the wake of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.The massacre was carried out by a gunman who bought two assault rifles shortly after turning 18.

But opponents have sought to cast mass shootings as primarily a mental health issue, not a weapons problem.The majority of Americans support tighter gun laws, but opposition from many Republican lawmakers has long been a hurdle to major changes."The will of the American people is being subverted by a minority," said Cynthia Martins, a 63-year-old resident of the US capital, referring to the Republican Party. "There's a reason that we're still in this situation." Some lawmakers are trying to pass gun regulations. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a broad package of proposals this week that included raising the purchasing age for most semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21 - but the party does not have the requisite 60 votes to advance it in the Senate.A cross-party group of senators has also been working on a narrow collection of controls that could develop into the first serious attempt at gun regulation reform in decades. But it does not include an assault weapons ban or universal background checks, meaning it will fall short of the expectations of President Joe Biden.Faith Barrett, a teacher who traveled to the rally with her daughter, also a teacher, voiced the frustration shared by many on the Mall. "We're still back in the same place," the 47-year-old said, voicing only "tentative" hope change would come.  Both she and her daughter have plans in place in case of a shooting at their school. "Most teachers look at every single classroom they go into and think, where am I going to put my kids if something happens," Barrett said. The specter of gun violence also hung over the rally, where police and security forces had a heavy presence.A moment of silence for the Uvalde victims was shaken by a brief panic when a disturbance near the stage sent people sprinting away in terror.While the crowd quickly calmed down and the man creating the disturbance was detained, with Park Police telling local media no weapons were found, some were left in shock and tears.Fred Guttenberg, the father of a Parkland victim, took to the podium to ease the crowd. "Unfortunately somebody decided to show up and put the fear that we live with everyday to life," he said.
