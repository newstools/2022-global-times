Instead, we wish them to participate in the events in a very fair, clean and moral way rather than counting the number of gold medals they got," explained Yang in response to questions and doubts on required success targets for Chinese athletes as China began to win growing numbers of medals in the Games.The Chinese team won another gold and silver medal in Short Track Speed Skating Men's 1000m on Monday evening. With a total of two golds and two silvers as of press time, Team China has now risen to the fourth place in the medal ranking.Global Times
