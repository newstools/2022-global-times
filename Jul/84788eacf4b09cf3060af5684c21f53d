Photo: XinhuaThe Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) strongly disapproved, firmly rejected and roundly condemned the slander against the practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong by some French politicians on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.The spokesperson of the Commissioner's Office made the statement on Monday, strongly disapproving some French politicians' gross interference into Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs that trample on the basic norms of international relations.The spokesperson pointed out that a few Western countries made irresponsible comments on the practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong and on Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs at such a festive moment for all Chinese people, which fully exposed their sinister intention to disrupt the stable Hong Kong and well-developed China.According to the spokesperson, these countries committed numerous colonial crimes in history and have a poor track record on human rights and development issues. How could they point a finger at Hong Kong by citing democracy and human rights, the spokesperson asked.Here is the message to these politicians: any smear about the successful practice of "one country, two systems" will be futile, any interference into China's internal affairs will never succeed, and no external force can stop the steady development of "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.According to the spokesperson, in the 25 years since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has fully leveraged its role as an important window and bridge connecting the Chinese mainland with the world, and maintained its status as an international financial, shipping and trading center. The constitutional order of the SAR, which is based on China's Constitution and the Basic Law of the SAR, has functioned smoothly. Hong Kong's remarkable development achievements fully prove that "one country, two systems" has strong vitality and is a good system for ensuring Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and safeguarding the well-being of Hong Kong compatriots.Hong Kong has transitioned from chaos to order and is on a new stage toward greater prosperity and effective governance. The national security law has closed the loophole in Hong Kong to safeguard national security and the improved electoral system has ensured that the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong" is implemented, the spokesperson said.We believe that with the able leadership and firm support of the central government, the strong backing of the motherland, and common efforts of more than 7 million Hong Kong compatriots, the patriotic Hong Kong governance team will lead all social sectors to open a new chapter for the HKSAR which will certainly enjoy a brighter future, the spokesperson noted.The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is part of China and the SAR's affairs are purely China's internal affairs. Hong Kong's stability and prosperity shall not be undermined.We urge the relevant countries to recognize the general trend, reflect on themselves, change course, abide by the international law and basic norms governing international relations, immediately stop the words and deeds that intend to disrupt Hong Kong and stop meddling with China's internal affairs. Otherwise, they will shoot themselves in the foot, the spokesperson said.
