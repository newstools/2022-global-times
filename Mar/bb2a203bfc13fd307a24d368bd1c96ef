Sooner or later we will have to do the whole roof again and that's a lot of money," Poosak told AFP.Historical theft While the culture ministry keeps a national heritage database, Phacha said many properties are not registered and fall through the cracks."For individual owners without state assistance... it's better for them to sell the property. Sell the individual building and then sell the [land]," she said.Adding to the challenge is a growing collectors' market for teak from Thai wooden houses, she said - some are even dismantled, relocated, and reassembled to become boutique hotels elsewhere."You want to keep these properties where they are... You're essentially robbing Bangkok of its [history]," Phacha said.Photographer Ben Davies spent five years documenting neighborhoods for his book Vanishing Bangkok, an experience that left him despondent."Something like [30-40 percent] of the buildings and communities I photographed had either disappeared or changed virtually beyond recognition," he told AFP.And in the rush to develop, Davies says it is unclear how much of Bangkok's heritage will remain in a decade."I have a horrible feeling that one day Bangkok will be, outside of its temples and few palaces, unrecognizable and have lost so much of its identity and character it will look like any other megacity around Asia," he said.A glimmer of hope? Elsewhere in the region offers Thailand possible solutions, notably Singapore which has won praise since the late 1980s for its heritage protection efforts.Its strategy examines the entire city-island holistically with conservation going hand-in-hand with planning, says Yeo Kang Shua, an architectural history expert at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. Underpinning the scheme is the "three R" principles: maximum retention of buildings, sensitive restoration and careful repair. "In the 1980s a lot of owners deemed it a death sentence for their properties to be given conservation status, but today because of the rarity of such buildings in Singapore, the real estate prices are... enormous," he told AFP.Despite the challenging environment, there are some signs of change in Bangkok.In recent years a prominent Sino-Thai business family renovated dilapidated Chinese 1850s warehouses, turning them into the Lhong 1919 "riverside heritage destination."It now houses a shrine and has become a space for exhibitions, concerts, pop-ups, cafes and food vans - and there are plans for a wellness resort.Back at So Heng Thai, Poosak takes his students through their paces. Channeling the attitude of his ancestors - who came to Thailand with "one pillow and one mattress" - he's determined to save his family home."If someone comes to give me an offer, the answer is no, simple as that, no matter how much it is."
