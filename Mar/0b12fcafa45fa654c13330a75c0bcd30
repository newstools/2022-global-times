Therefore, the economic factor was usually the priority when selecting the location of wind farms," Wei explained. China's eastern and middle regions have urgent need for electricity with large populations and industries. Building wind farms there could shorten electricity transmission and facilitate equipment maintenance, said Wei, adding that the wind turbines on the top of the hills also spoil the visual aesthetics and natural scenery.

Construction should be made under the condition that clear and specific requirements for ecological conservation are made in the national standards for wind farms based on scientific research and assessment. Dynamic environment monitoring should be ensured to be performed while the farms are under operation," Wei mentioned.
