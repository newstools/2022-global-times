The exhibition is expected to change the situation by finding more direct connectivity between Chinese and Afghan traders.Bilateral trade has seen a renewed boost with Afghan pine nuts getting access to the Chinese market, a prelude to the gradual recovery of bilateral agricultural trade.On November 1, 2021, the first charter plane carrying 45 tons of pine nuts arrived in Shanghai. After entering the China International Import Expo, 120,000 bottles of pine nuts from Afghanistan were sold out as soon as they appeared.

Local products such as nuts, sheepskins and saffron are competitive in the Chinese market, but they also lack channels to enter the market, Yan Wei, professor with the Institute of Middle Eastern Studies of Northeast University, told the Global Times on Sunday.But lingering concerns such as regional stability and risks from sanctions by the West will remain major hurdles for Chinese investors to do business in the South Asian country, industry experts said.It would be more at the level of trade rather than investment cooperation, given that the investment risk for Chinese enterprises in Afghanistan is still relatively high, Yan said."Although there are some investment promotions in Afghanistan, including high-value minerals, the investment is still difficult and the investment cycle is long," Yan said.
