The June figure went up 13 percentage points from May, according to Caixin's survey released on Tuesday.Caixin manufacturing PMI also recorded a 13-month high in June at 51.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 reflects contraction.Both indexes indicate a quick recovery of economic prosperity in the country.The Caixin China composite PMI, a weighted average of manufacturing and service PMI, rose to 55.3, the highest since January 2021, reflecting the resumption of growth in pro-duction and business activities.Both supply and demand for services picked up in June, the Caixin survey showed. The services business activity index and new orders index returned to expansion territory in June, with supply improving faster than demand.Companies surveyed said that with the relaxation of quarantine measures, business activi-ties had resumed. At the same time, the number of customers and levels of spending had risen, supporting sales recovery.Although business activities in the service sector rebounded strongly in June, the business expectations index was unchanged from May, and some companies are still worried that the epidemic will continue to affect business and customer demand in the future.The index of new export orders in the service sector, for example, fell into contraction ter-ritory for the sixth consecutive month, of which companies attributed to COVID-19 and travel restrictions.Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said the production and operation order of enterprises have gradually returned to normal and the service sector, which had been more affected by the epidemic, has been recovering more strongly."The resumption of work and production as well as the resumption of transportation and logistics will be reflected first on the supply side. It will take time for demand to recover. Manufacturing enterprises still face high-cost pressure and profitability challenges," said Wang.Wang noted that the slower recovery in demand should be attributed to a weak job market, which has led to a deterioration in incomes and expectations.Therefore, it is suggested that assistance and rescue policies should focus more on affected enterprise employees, flexible workers and low-income groups, said Wang.Global Times
