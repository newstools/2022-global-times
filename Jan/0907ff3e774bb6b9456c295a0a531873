Gulbar wrote that during the incident, he had been liaising from England with law enforcement at the scene."Although my brother was suffering from mental health issues we were confident that he would not harm the hostages," he wrote.But he added: "There was nothing we could have said to him or done that would have convinced him to surrender."His family was devastated and their priority now was to get his brother's body back to Britain for his funeral.US authorities have launched an investigation with "global reach" into a 44-year-old Akram who was killed after holding four people hostage at the synagogue.
