And unfortunately, what they've done is they've offered us a bribe to run the new intercity fleet the way it is without modifications," said RTBU State Secretary Alex Claassens on Friday after the union was unable to come to an agreement with the government.NSW Transport Minister David Elliott told local radio 2GB on Monday morning that he was disappointed with the union's decision."These are negotiations, and I am more disappointed they are taking actions whilst an offer is before them," he said.In February, Sydney's entire rail network was shut down due to a dispute between the union and the NSW government.Xinhua
