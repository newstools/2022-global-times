He said this situation should not be carried to the next generation in Hong Kong, according to a report by Wenweipo.Hong Kong has carried out patriotic education in schools in recent years, such as adding national education content to school curricula, launching courses related to national security, and promoting campus flag-raising activities.Kenneth Fok Kai-kong, a CPPCC National Committee member and a lawmaker in the 7th-term LegCo, said that the youth patriotism activities in Hong Kong should place more emphasis on education about the national anthem and flag as they are symbols of the country and should be respected by every citizen, Peoples Daily reported.In addition to schools, there should also be a long-term education plan for civil servants in the SAR government under the "HK patriots governing HK" drive, some NPC deputies noted.Henry Cai Yi, a deputy to the NPC and chairman of Hong Kong Island Federation, proposed that civil servants should receive more training to get a comprehensive understanding of Chinas national conditions and policies, especially the Constitution, the Basic Law of Hong Kong and the National Security Law for Hong Kong and other laws, China News reported.
