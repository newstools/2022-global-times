It was difficult... I did not expect this," he said tearfully.Nearby, Flavio Jose da Silva has been desperately looking for his stepfather Gilvan in the rubble of what was once his house. Shortly after it collapsed, he heard Gilvan say, "I'm here, under the ground.""We hope to find him alive," an emotional Da Silva said, pointing to a mountain of debris.AFP
