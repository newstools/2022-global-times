The mail was sent from Canada on January 7, transferred via the US and China's Hong Kong region before reaching Beijing on January 11.Beijing CDC officials said the Omicron variant was detected on the outer package, internal surface and papers of the mail.Meanwhile, a patient from Shenzhen, who was confirmed to be infected with Omicron on January 16, is likely to have contracted the virus after being exposed to contaminated goods from overseas, Shenzhen's health authorities said at a press conference on January 17. The patient, whose work involved handling overseas frozen reagents for collection and delivery, had touched and opened packages from North America without using personal protective gear.China's postal administration has vowed to "build a barrier" against COVID-19 cases imported through international express mail.Global Times
