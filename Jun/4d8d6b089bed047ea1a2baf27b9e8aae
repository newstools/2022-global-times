And like Venezuela, it is subject to tough US sanctions."Venezuela has passed hard years but the determination of the people, the officials and the president of the country was that they should resist the sanctions," Raisi said in  a statement during the joint news conference."This is a good sign that proves to everyone that resistance will work and will force the enemy to retreat," the Iranian president added.In addition to the 20-year accord inked by the two countries' foreign ministers, "Iran and Venezuela signed documents on cooperation in the political, cultural, tourism, economic, oil and petrochemical fields," state news agency IRNA said."We have important projects of cooperation between Iran and Venezuela in the fields of energy, petrochemicals, oil, gas and refineries," Maduro said.From July 18, direct flights would operate between Caracas and Tehran "in order to promote tourism and the union between our countries," he said, adding that "Venezuela is open to receive tourists from Iran."Iran's president said direct flights would pave the way for enhanced "trade and economic relations, as well as bringing the two nations closer together."The two presidents took part via videoconference in a ceremony marking the delivery of the second of four Iranian-built oil tankers to Venezuela, IRNA reported.Ties between the two oil producers were strong under late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez and have been further bolstered under his successor Maduro.AFP
