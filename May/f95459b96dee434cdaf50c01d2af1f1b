It was a stampede because a church was trying to give out palliatives,” Iringe-Koko said in a statement.The event was scheduled to start by 9 am local time, but some people went there earlier and broke into the place, resulting in the stampede, said the spokesperson.“So people started rushing in and there was a stampede,” she said.Speaking to Xinhua on the phone, Iringe-Koko said rescue operators are working at the scene of the incident, and an investigation has been launched by the police to ascertain the remote and immediate causes of the incident.According to the spokesperson, the nature of the church program was bound to attract a crowd.A stampede incident in December 2020 also claimed some lives when a crowd gathered for a Christmas palliative organized by an online sales platform in Port Harcourt, according to local broadcaster Channels TV on Saturday.Xinhua
