Most of the firms said the impact is limited, while others, whose suppliers are located in areas that are still subject to anti-epidemic measures, expect a full resumption of the supply chain from Monday.According to the latest COVID-19 control measures announced by the Shenzhen municipal government on Sunday, differentiated epidemic prevention measures will be implemented. Shenzhen will implement a "customized" epidemic control policy for each individual enterprise or factory to ensure the safety and stability of the industrial chain and supply chain, which will be effective for a week starting from Monday.A 48-hour nucleic acid test negative result is required for entering or leaving public places or taking public transport.

Some companies are back to 80 percent of normal capacity, and some leading companies say they have fully recovered."We worked out the latest work resumption policy at the company level overnight on Friday and are now returning to work in an orderly manner," a manager surnamed Fu at an electronics enterprise in Shenzhen's Yantian district told the Global Times on Sunday.According to Fu, the company is expected to bring back its "lost" capacity during the production suspension within a week.All employees of the company strictly abide by local epidemic prevention and control policies and requirements, and actively devote themselves to their work through on-site and online means, Shenzhen-based BGI told the Global Times on Sunday.A port logistics company said that it only accepts shipments between Yantian Port and Yantian district and four other district-level areas, while businesses in the rest of the areas in Shenzhen have not resumed."Our industrial park in Guangming district has resumed work and production, but only staffers living in the five areas can return to their posts in person. Those living in other areas in Shenzhen have not returned to their posts.
