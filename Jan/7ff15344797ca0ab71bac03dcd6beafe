Donors seek to use the money as leverage over the Taliban on issues including human rights."There is compelling evidence of an emerging environment of intimidation and deterioration in respect for human rights. This suggests that the consolidation of government authority may be leading toward control of the population by fear," the UN special envoy on Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, told the council.In December 2021, donors to a frozen World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund agreed to transfer $280 million to the World Food Program and UN children's agency UNICEF to support nutrition and health in Afghanistan. Guterres said the remaining $1.2 billion in the fund needed "to be freed up urgently to help Afghanistan's people survive the winter."The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council that Washington had moved to ensure that US sanctions do not impede humanitarian activity and it is examining various options to ease the liquidity crunch. The UN in January appealed for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022.
