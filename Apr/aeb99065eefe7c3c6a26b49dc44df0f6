I don't understand how our cooperation poses 'serious risks' to the US," Wang said.If the US line of argument is followed, does that mean the Pacific Island countries can only carry out security cooperation with the US and its few allies? Does that mean cooperation with other countries are deemed threats? Does the US see the Pacific Island countries as sovereign states or its dependencies? Is the US seeking to develop equal-footed relations with the Pacific island countries or control them? All these are questions for the US to answer, Wang pointed out.International cooperation should be win-win cooperation. However, the US and Australia try to exclude China from the South Pacific region and regard this region as their own backyard, which is repugnant to the local government and people, Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.In today's world, no country should override another, impose its will on others, or ask others to do or not do anything. Such bullying practices are doomed to fail, Chen said.As the Australian Labor Party called the handling of the issue by the current administration "the greatest Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since World War II," Chen said this remark would be more regarded as election language during the national election campaign, while pointing out that it is Australia's move of serving US hegemony that is the country's "greatest foreign policy blunder in the Pacific."After a flurry of visits by Australian officials that failed to thwart the security pact, White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell met on Wednesday in Suva with Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama to discuss regional security, and will also travel to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Reuters reported.The rare, high-level visit is trying to not only nullify the security pact, but also gather an anti-China small group, which is ridiculous, Chen believes.The expert predicted that in the future, the US is likely to increase its investment in military cooperation and civilian exchanges in Pacific island nations, and may make more commitments to them than in the past. But considering its goal is to serve its own hegemony and try to suppress China, it is impossible to get recognition from local people and governments, Chen noted.
