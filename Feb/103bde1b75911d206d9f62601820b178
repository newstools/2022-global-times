Police take over an intersection leading to Parliament on the ninth day of protests against COVID-19 restrictions in Wellington, New Zealand on February 16, 2022, inspired by a similar demonstration in Canada. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has referred to the protests as an "imported" phenomenon and rejected calls to remove all restrictions.

"Some officers also had human waste thrown over them by protesters."Police said they would "hold to account" those responsible, pointing out that attempting to deliberately infect someone with a disease can attract a 14-year jail term.Police have largely taken a hands-off approach to the protest, saying attempts to forcibly clear the camp from parliament would result in violence."Police would have to move in using batons, probably using tear gas, to clear that crowd off the grounds - it's likely to lead to extended confrontation," Commissioner Andrew Coster told TVNZ Sunday.Coster also said he had been in contact with authorities in Ottawa, where police in riot gear dislodged the trucker protest over the weekend after more than three weeks.The Wellington protest began as a movement against vaccine mandates but has grown to encompass a range of grievances, with some far-right messaging among the anti-government and anti-media slogans on display.Wellington residents have complained about being abused for wearing masks, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern condemning "bullying and harassment" of residents."The protesters have made their point, it is time for them to leave," she told reporters.AFP
