For instance, the trading ac-tivities were not active enough and there were some problems involving data quality, Ma not-ed.Currently there's only one thermal power industry involved in the trading system, it is ex-pected that more industries could be concluded in the system so as to boost the trading activi-ties, he added.According to the plan of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), the national carbon market will gradually cover eight ener-gy-intensive industries including power generation, iron and steel, building materials, non-ferrous metals, petrochemical, chemical, paper and aviation. About 8,500 large carbon-emitting enterprises will be included in the trading system, and managing about 70 percent of the country's total energy-related carbon emissions.Ma also noted that the improvement of related laws and regulations is a key aspect that needs to be enhanced. Interim regulations on the administration of carbon market trading have been put on the legislative plan list of the State Council, China's cabinet.Carbon trading is the process of buying and selling permits to emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.Global Times
