And during the wait, I attracted the attention of a Mongolian reporter as well. "Do you mind if I ask you some questions?" the Mongolian reporter asked while holding a microphone, his eyes sweeping the crowd trying to figure out just how popular this icy shelled panda mascot was.The Mongolian reporter asked several customers if they were coming to buy the Bing Dwen Dwen mascot, but most refused his interview before he came to GT for an answer."Yes," I replied, adding that the volunteers in the shop had said that all the Bing Dwen Dwen-related souvenirs were already sold out, as this round-bodied heart-winning panda toy has been so popular among Olympic fans.The Mongolian reporter also expressed his feelings toward the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, and told GT that he wanted to visit Beijing again as "it is not very far.""This is my first time in China," he said. "The volunteers and staff here are very welcoming and attentive and they've done a great job in all-round services [at Beijing 2022.] I would really love to visit China again."
