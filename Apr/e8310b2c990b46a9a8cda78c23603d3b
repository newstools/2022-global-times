Neighboring Finland, which shares a border with Russia, is gearing up for a similar policy decision by early summer.Sweden is officially non-aligned militarily, although it is a NATO partner and abandoned its position of strict neutrality after the end of the Cold War.Having initially stressed that non-alignment had "served Sweden's interests well," the prime minister conceded that she was ready to discuss the policy and in late March said she "did not rule out" a bid to join NATO.The debate, open to all party members, will be "a broader discussion than the question of a yes or no to NATO membership," Tobias Baudin, Social Democrats secretary general, said in a statement.The "security policy dialogue" should be completed before the summer, he said.AFP
