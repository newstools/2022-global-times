The Swedish Embassy in China congratulated the duo for their victory in a post on Sina Weibo on Tuesday. The embassy said this was de Val's first Olympic trip. She won the gold medal of the World Curling Championships in 2017.The Chinese office of the company Akzo Nobel N.V told the media that de Val began to prepare for the Olympics from the beginning of January and the company totally supports her to compete at the sporting event."This is a perfect example of work and life balance," said de Val's Chinese colleague in Shanghai. "Her reason to leave is to participate in the Olympics. It seems like a very ordinary and trivial thing."The Swedish athlete's case has driven many Chinese netizens to try to understand the real meaning of sports."I think she really enjoys her life. After work and study, we all can choose a sports event as our hobby. Fitting into life is the meaning of the sports," one Sina Weibo user wrote. Almida De Val had left for Sweden after she completed her competition in Beijing and she will return to work on Monday (February 14).
