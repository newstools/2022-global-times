A wide raised tin roof protects the building from rain while helping air circulate, meaning natural ventilation without any need for air conditioning.Kere engaged the local community during the design and building phase, and the number of students at the school increased from 120 to 700, the Hyatt Foundation said in its release.The success of the project saw the creation of an extension, a library and teachers' housing in later years.Kere "empowers and transforms communities through the process of architecture," designing buildings "where resources are fragile and fellowship is vital," the statement added."Through his commitment to social justice and engagement, and intelligent use of local materials to connect and respond to the natural climate, he works in marginalized countries laden with constraints and adversity," the organizers said.In Burkina Faso, his accolade was hailed as a reminder that Burkina Faso should be known internationally for more than the violent jihadist insurgency that has gripped the country.Groups affiliated to Al-Qaeda and the so-called Islamic State group have killed more than 2,000 people and displaced at least 1.7 million."In the current pain of the security crisis, our country must remember that it is also the nation of exceptional men like Francis Kere," said Ra-Sablga Seydou Ouedraogo, of the nonprofit Free Afrik. Nebila Aristide Bazie, head of the Burkina Faso architects' council, said the award "highlights the African architect and the people of Burkina Faso."In 2017, Kere became the first African architect to design the Serpentine pavilion in London's Hyde Park, a prestigious assignment given to a world-famous architect every year.He was also one of the architects behind Geneva's International Red Cross and Red CresCent Museum."I am totally convinced that everyone deserves quality," he said in his office, where he celebrated with his team."I'm always thinking how can I get the best for my clients, for those who can afford but also for those who cannot afford."This is my way of doing things, of using my architecture to create structures to serve people, let's say to serve humanity," Kere added.
