They produce four to 10 times more oil than other vegetable oil crops per unit of cultivated land.Palm oil is used in a wide range of food and household products, from biscuits, ice cream and chocolate spread to soaps and cosmetics, as well as in biofuels.Malaysia and Indonesia account for about 90 percent of global palm oil output, while India, Indonesia, and Europe are the main consumers.Sabah produced about 5 million tons of palm oil in 2020, or 6 percent of the global total, according to WWF.How have palm plantations impacted Southeast Asia's forests?Across Indonesia and Malaysia, about 4.5 million people earn their living from palm oil production. The business has helped lift millions out of poverty, industry officials say.But in many parts of the two Southeast Asian nations, the clearance of land to grow oil palm has caused deforestation, despite pledges by big firms to end it.Indonesia, which introduced a moratorium on primary forest clearing in 2011, was among the top four countries for rainforest loss in 2020 according to Global Forest Watch, a satellite monitoring service. Malaysia was ranked ninth.Malaysia, which has lost nearly a fifth of its old-growth forest since 2001, set a five-year cap on its total palm oil plantation area in 2019.About 65 percent of Sabah state is still covered by lush forests, home to often-endangered wildlife including wild boar, orangutans, proboscis monkeys and pygmy elephants.Just over half of its forests are designated as reserves or protected by law, officials say.Stop deforestation Destroying rainforest has major implications for international goals to curb climate change as trees absorb about a third of the planet-warming emissions produced worldwide, but release carbon back into the air when they rot or are burned.Forests also help clean up air and water, support human health, offer flood protection, and mitigate heat in cities.Slash-and-burn practices linked to palm oil production are often blamed for the annual Indonesian forest fires whose smoke creates a thick haze over large parts of Southeast Asia.Malaysia and Indonesia are among the more than 100 nations that pledged to halt deforestation by 2030 at November 2021's COP26 climate summit, after previous efforts failed to make headway.Conservationists say Sabah's green standards drive could be replicated elsewhere and help countries achieve their pledges to cut climate-heating emissions.Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and campaigners has pushed big corporations that grow, trade, and buy palm oil to tackle labor abuses on plantations and commit to ending deforestation.Some major buyers, including Italian confectioner Ferrero and Cheerios cereal-maker General Mills, have pledged only to procure supplies certified as sustainable.Both producers and buyers have also teamed up with green groups to monitor and rid supply chains of deforestation by investing in tracking technologies.Some other palm oil buyers have switched to using alternative vegetable oils.But all those efforts have yet to bear much fruit.High-profile companies in the Consumer Goods Forum struggled to meet a 2020 goal set a decade earlier to buy only sustainably produced commodities, including palm oil, soy and beef.Forum members, including Carrefour, Walmart, General Mills, Mars, Nestle, Unilever and PepsiCo, in 2020 launched a "Forest Positive Coalition of Action" in a new bid to stop commodity supply chains fuelling forest loss and to curb climate change.The RSPO, an industry body of consumers, green groups and growers that promotes the use of certified sustainable palm-oil products, tightened its rules in 2018, imposing a ban on clearing forests and converting peatland for plantations.Singapore, meanwhile, has set its sights on becoming the first country to use only sustainable palm oil by 2023 under a green push to tackle forest fires and air pollution.Reuters
