Photo: Fan Wei/GTDebris of the upper stage of the Long March-5B Y3 carrier rocket has reentered the atmosphere at 12:55 am on Sunday, with the vast majority of the device burned up during the re-entry, said China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) on Sunday.The remnants fell into the surrounding sea area at 119.0 degrees east longitude and 9.1 degrees north latitude, read a statement of the CMSA.The CMSA has been closely tracking the trajectory information of the debris of the upper stage of the carrier rocket since it successfully delivered the Wentian lab module of China's space station into orbit on July 24. CMSA had released statements reporting the debris' position four times during the past week.However, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has accused China of not sharing "specific trajectory information" as the rocket fell back to Earth in a statement on Twitter, reported CNN.Some Western media have claimed that space debris of the Long March-5B Y3 is supposedly falling back to Earth in an "uncontrolled descent."Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian debuted such accusations on Wednesday, saying that China has been closely monitoring the process of the reentry of the rocket's upper stage into the Earth's atmosphere.Zhao stressed that China has all along pursued the peaceful use of outer space in accordance with international laws and the international customary practice.Global Times
