After driving for about an hour and nearing the destination, Hua received a phone call from police."A fugitive is in your car!" a policeman told the driver on the phone. What made Hua even more nervous was the fact that the speakerphone was on when he received the call. Police had checked the fugitive's identity with Hua and asked him to bring him to the nearest police station.During the conversation, the fugitive, surnamed Zhang, who was sitting in the front passenger seat besides Hua, was seemingly asleep. Hua quickly turned off the speakerphone and locked the side doors, but then realized the passenger was awake. Luckily, however, the fugitive didn't seem to understand what they were talking about.The fugitive was successfully apprehended by police after Hua mistakenly stopped the car at a building, where a policeman happened to be stationed. Global Times
