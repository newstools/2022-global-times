An emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on Ukraine is held at the UN headquarters in New York, Feb. 28, 2022. (Xinhua/Wang Ying) Citing “anonymous officials” to release disinformation is an old trick the US has been using to mislead the public. The Global Times has learned from various sources that previous reports that said China had asked Russia not to take actions in Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics cited ‘anonymous officials” from the National Security Council and US' purpose is to shift its own responsibility in the conflicts to profit from it and smear China.In two reports, released on February 25 and March 2, the New York Times cited “anonymous US officials” saying that China had learned about Russia’s plans in Ukraine and asked Russia not to take actions before the end of the Winter Olympics. The reports accused China of standing with Russia to criticize the US and oppose US sanctions on Russia. The Chinese Foreign Ministry had refuted the reports and pointed out that the US fabricated information to smear China.Citing “anonymous officials” to release disinformation to mislead the public is an old trick that the US has been playing. Through various sources, the Global Times has learned that the “anonymous officials” cited by the New York Times are from the National Security Council of the White House. Coincidentally, despite the Ukraine situation, the US seems to have increased its investment in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s increasing influence, which makes clear the US attempt to shift problems on the Ukraine situation and to profit from other countries’ conflicts. Analysts say the problems associated with the Ukraine situation are clear and the US and NATO are together pushing Ukraine to the fire. As the initiator of the conflicts in Ukraine, the US is adding oil to the fire while accusing China of not making its efforts in helping, which is irresponsible and immoral, the analysts said.
