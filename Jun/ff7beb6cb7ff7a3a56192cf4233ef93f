The revised law includes a section for the protection of the health of minors that prohibits parents from encouraging kids to smoke e-cigarettes.  In Chinese colleges, 15 percent of the male students used to smoke in 2021 while the rate of female students was just 1.1 percent, according to the China’s CDC’s latest survey. Among the college smokers, 52.5 percent plan to quit smoking in the upcoming 12 months and 33 percent have tried to quit smoking in the past 12 months. About half of the college smokers spend more than 16 yuan ($2.4) to buy a pack of cigarettes in 2021, which is higher than the Chinese adult smokers’ 9.9 yuan average spending on one pack of cigarettes in 2018. More than 90 percent of college students have heard of and more than 10 percent have tried it while 2.5 percent use it regularly in 2021, according to the China’s CDC’s latest survey. According to data revealed by the Chinese education ministry in 2021, as of 2020, there were about 900 million students in middle schools and nearly 42 million college students in the Chinese mainland.
