Chinese customs Photo: VCGChina's customs seized 71.8 million illicit items over intellectual property (IP) infringements during import and export inspections in 2021, following strengthened national supervision of IP protection, according to the Chinese General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Tuesday. In addressing Olympics-related IP protection in the GAC's nationwide campaigns, 118,000 illicit logos, pins, flags, garments and sunglasses were seized in 2021, the GAC said.Starting in early 2021, the GAC launched inspection campaigns targeting IP infringements across different phases of international trade, using advanced equipment to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the work.The GAC also worked to improve services for domestic companies to register their IPs with the agency, resulting in 17,667 newly registered IP items in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 17 percent. China has been stepping up efforts regarding IP protection in a bid to improve the innovative environment for enterprises, and further improve legal protection for emerging industries in the world's second-largest economy.In September 2021, China issued a plan for 2021-2035 to strengthen the building and protection of IP rights, by accelerating legislation on such rights in new fields and forms of business, such as big data, artificial intelligence, algorithms and genetic technology.By 2025, the added value of patent-intensive industries is expected to be equivalent to 13 percent of China's GDP, and that of the copyright industry for 7.5 percent.The annual trade of IP royalties will reach 350 billion yuan ($54.1 billion). By 2035, the comprehensive competitiveness of IP rights shall rank among the top in the world, per the plan.Meanwhile, various local governments have also released their own plans to beef up IP protection, amid growing national focus on the matter as well as urgency to boost innovation.Shanghai, for example, recently released a action plan, aiming to build the city into a leading international IP center by 2035, with improved mechanisms and services supporting IP protection and strengthened international cooperation.Global Times
