The current 240 positive infections spread in five areas of Inner Mongolia, with Erenhot, located in Xilingol League and bordering Mongolia, affected the most. Senior local official urged to cut off viral transmission at a quick speed. Wang Lixia, the deputy Party chief of Inner Mongolia, noted on Tuesday that the epidemic in Erenhot, the focal point of this wave of epidemic resurgence, is severely complicated, stressing a quick speed to contain the virus. Latest data released at Wednesday's press conference showed that Erenhot was hit by Omicron, which infected 224 people in the city with most showing mild symptoms. The region now registers seven high-risk areas and one medium-risk area for COVID-19.Since June 2, Erenhot has imposed static management with all communities under strict management and all residents being encouraged to work from home. The routes in and out of the city were suspended. If people would like to leave for special reasons, they should apply to local anti-epidemic department. Another city, Chifeng, required all people at public posts to work from home. Two certificates of negative nucleic acid tests taken within 48 hours are required to leave the city. Global Times
