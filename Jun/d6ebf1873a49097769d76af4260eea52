One of the inmates set fire - he was angry, upset - to a mattress, which provoked the blaze," said Ruiz.There were 180 inmates in the prison section affected by the fire.Castellanos praised the efforts of prison guards to control the blaze and help prisoners to safety.Outgoing President Ivan Duque sent a tweet offering his solidarity with relatives of the victims."We regret the events that occurred in the prison in Tulua, Valle del Cauca," Duque said."I have given instructions to clarify this terrible situation. My solidarity is with the families of the victims."AFP
