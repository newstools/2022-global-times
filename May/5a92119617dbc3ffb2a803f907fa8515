The policies also signaled an easing of real estate curbs, encouraging different cities to form their own real estate policies to support home buying. In terms of infrastructure, the country will kick off a new batch of water conservation projects, covering large-scale irrigation projects, transportation projects, renovation of old residential areas and underground utility tunnels.The measures were announced following an executive meeting of the State Council on Monday. The meeting also stressed the need to stabilize supply chains, smooth cargo logistics and cancel travel restrictions from low-risks areas, while gradually adding domestic and international flights.These policies are mainly designed for the current complex economic environment, with a large policy intensity and wide range of policy support that covers both the supply and demand sides, Zhou Maohua, a macroeconomic analyst at Everbright Bank, told the Global Times on Monday."It is expected that the policies will offer a boost to the transportation, logistics, automobile, real estate, infrastructure, energy and agricultural industries," Zhou said.Global Times
