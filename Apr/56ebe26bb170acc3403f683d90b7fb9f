He also violated the rules by interfering in the market economy and engaging in corruptive activities with his family members.According to prosecutors, Zhou's huge amount of bribery dates back to his time as deputy head of Yinxian County in Ningbo in Zhejiang Province from 2001 to 2002. An anti-graft TV series produced by China's discipline inspection authorities also revealed the details of Zhou's case. As Zhejiang is a dynamic place for the market economy, some local officials used relatives to engage in commerce, and Zhou used his power to benefit the business of his brother, Zhou Jianyong.The documentary also revealed that Zhou Jianyong was keen to make friends with people running different enterprises while touting Zhou Jiangyong's power and position in the process. Some companies then bought stakes in Zhou Jianyong's company at apparently unreasonably high prices in exchange for Zhou Jiangyong's help in securing cheap land and preferential policies.Besides, a Chinese media known for its political coverage noted that it is the first time that the statement Zhou Jiangyong is accused of "colluded with the capital and supported capital expanding disorderly" has appeared in the disciplinary notice of the central government officials, and it is also rare for the statement, "the selection and appointment of officials in violation of regulations at the request of private business owners," to be used.Zhou seriously violated the Party's political disciplines and his actions, including taking bribes, constituted a serious duty violation, which has to be dealt with seriously, the CCDI said.Zhou Jiangyong's case was recently prosecuted by the People's Procuratorate of Chuzhou at the Chuzhou Intermediate People's Court after Zhou was expelled from the Party and from public office.Global Times
