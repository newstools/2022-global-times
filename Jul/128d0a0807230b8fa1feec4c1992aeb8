The teams are expected to submit their final short films on day three, with the film screening taking place on the last day of the festival," she explained.For the 2022 iteration, the festival is themed around seven of the 17 Agenda 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals - poverty, health, quality education, gender equality, innovation, climate change and governance - Simeon said, adding that registration commenced Monday.Simeon also noted that the participants will be required to pitch solution-driven story ideas related to current societal issues around these topics to develop into short films."Emphasis is drawn to films that have a strong focus on building a more inclusive and sustainable Namibian economy and society that is more resilient in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and other global challenges from a youth perspective," she concluded.
