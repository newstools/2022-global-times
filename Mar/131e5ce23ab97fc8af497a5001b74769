Wang said China has noticed that both sides have released positive signals during the talks, and the international community should support the two sides to continue the talks and achieve results and lasting peace.  China has always agreed that dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to resolve the Ukraine crisis, and called on Russia and Ukraine to stick to it. The two sides should reach a consensus on a political solution, avoid further escalation of the situation and restore peace at an early date, said Wang.  The international community should say and do more that is conducive to dialogue and negotiation and support Russia and Ukraine in continuing talks for results and peace.  We should be cautious of those practices that add fuel to the fire and intensify tensions, and acts that create obstacles to the diplomatic settlement of the crisis, the spokesperson said.
