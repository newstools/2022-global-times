Photo: WeiboWhile Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed her support for Ukraine on Twitter with pictures of some buildings in the island lit up with the Ukrainian flag's colors, some netizens mocked the Tsai authority for simply following the West in showing "verbal support" for Ukraine, saying this is ironic when the island is facing electricity shortage. Yellow and blue lights lit up the Taipei 101 and several buildings in Kaohsiung on Saturday night, according to Taiwan media. Tsai tweeted the pictures of the light shows later, saying that "Our 'country' and people #StandWithUkraine against Russian 'aggression'." Although the tweet won praising comments from some of Tsai's followers, others mocked the gesture of "demonstrating support with light shows" as simply following the cities of some western countries who "support" Ukraine, instead of really "standing with" the country where the situation has become increasingly difficult with constant fighting.  "Why only support online? How can these light shows help Ukraine?" said one Twitter user.Some people also pointed out that putting on grand light shows is a waste of electricity especially when the island has been facing a challenging electricity shortage. "It is such a waste of power since you like to 'generate electricity with love'," read another comment on Twitter."Providing no actual support to Ukraine and also increasing electricity usage, what a 'clever' strategy," said a netizen on Sina Weibo. Taiwan's light shows took place after some cities in Western countries hyped up their support for Ukraine with the same demonstrations. On Friday, the Eiffel Tower lit up in blue and yellow, the colors of Ukraine, with Paris Mayor, Anne Hidalgo, saying this is an expression of solidarity with the country. Besides, some buildings in Italy, Australia, Germany and other countries were also lit up with the colors of the Ukraine flag.
