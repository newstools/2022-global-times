At present, 67 out of 134 A-level scenic spots in Shanghai have been reopened.The tale of two cities in China – Beijing and Shanghai – should see the final curtain come down as the two metropolises emerge from the Omicron shadow, with both registering zero new infections on Monday.The Shanghai Municipal Health Commission said Wednesday that there were no new locally confirmed cases or asymptomatic infections in the city on Tuesday, noting that the city has not had any new cases or infections for two consecutive days.Local authorities reminded the public to follow necessary epidemic prevention and control measures, including showing nucleic acid negative certificates and their “green code” before entering venues, keeping a proper distance while wearing masks, and reporting any abnormal cases to health authorities.The Shanghai Disney Resort, the most-loved theme park in China, also announced it will reopen on June 30, and tickets will be available for sale from June 29. Strengthened health and safety measures will be in place once the resort reopens.After imposing a two-month citywide lockdown that was lifted on June 1, Shanghai authorities finally declared victory against the latest round of the outbreak, following two consecutive days of zero new infections reported in the city.
