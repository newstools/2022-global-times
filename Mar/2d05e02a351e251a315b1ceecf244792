Qualified firms engaging in the research and development of farming machines and equipment will be encouraged to issue corporate bonds to commercialize their research.The measures represent good intentions in expanding rural financing, but their implementation and efforts will be indispensable for the country's rural revitalization push to be genuinely empowered, Li emphasized.That means an exchange is needed where rural assets used as collateral can be traded or monetized if the loans made on such assets aren't repaid, he suggested.
