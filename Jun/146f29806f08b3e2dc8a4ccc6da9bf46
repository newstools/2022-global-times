The ministry said air traffic would remain suspended until repair work is finished and airport security can be assured."Civil aviation and national companies are working... to repair the sizeable damage at the airport," the ministry said, adding a terminal building was also hit.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the missile strike before dawn on Friday hit the only runway still in service at the airport, as well as several adjacent buildings. Israeli bombing in 2021 had disabled another runway, it said. "The runway, the control tower, three hangars, warehouses as well as reception rooms were badly damaged by the Israeli strikes," the Observatory said.Some of the reception rooms were used to receive Iranian officials and Hezbollah members while the warehouses stored weapons from Iran, it said.The Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources within Syria, said the strikes wounded an undetermined number of people.Satellite images posted on Twitter by the Israeli firm ISI showed three separate areas of what it said was "extensive damage to both military and civilian runways" caused by the strikes.The airport is in a region south of Damascus where Iran-backed groups, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, regularly operate.AFP
