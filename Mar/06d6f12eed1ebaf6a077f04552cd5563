Only 25 percent of unmarried men and less than 20 percent of unmarried women think these policies would influence their childbirth plans, according to the study. Besides, 60 percent of unmarried Chinese women are sure that they wouldn't accept out-of-wedlock childbirth. Despite Chinese people's attitudes towards childbearing having become more open and some deputies to the National People's Congress even suggesting during this year's two sessions to allow unmarried women aged 30 or above to have one child and enjoy legitimate maternity leave, maternity insurance and other rights and interests as married women have, as many as 60 percent of unmarried Chinese women still won't accept unmarried births. Out-of-wedlock childbirth is still inconsistent with traditional Confucianism concepts which are widely accepted in East Asian countries including China, He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the Global Times. According to the study, the unmarried population remain more cautious when they are unprepared for childbearing, with 90 percent of unmarried people taking contraception measures to prevent unexpected pregnancies.According to the study, the unmarried population's low childbearing willingness is also a result from multiple factors such as fear of childbirth, high costs of childbirth and childrearing and uncertainty toward future marriage apart from the conventional factors that affect the willingness of childbearing such as property prices, health care, education, job stress and income. The research also shows nearly 50 percent of unmarried women and 30 percent of women who are divorced are unwilling to give up their jobs to be stay-at-home moms, since women's position in social development is becoming more and more prominent, and the traditional pattern of family division of labor has changed.Global Times
