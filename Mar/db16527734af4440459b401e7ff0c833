We don't play with our prices. They're linked to manufacturing costs and not to desirability."He argued that the craftsmanship that goes into making Hermes bags means that they are "perhaps less susceptible to rising energy and raw materials prices than others."Swiss group Richemont, which owns Cartier and runs its business year from April to March, said it booked sales of 5.6 billion euros in the third quarter alone, an increase of 38 percent over the corresponding period of 2019.'There are limits' "In certain cases demand exceeds supply and that means consumers will both trade up and likely accept paying higher prices, which again will cushion the margin," said analysts at HSBC.Rolex, for example, had largely refrained from increasing prices during the last two years.But at the start of 2022, it raised prices by more than 3 percent on average "and for some models they soared as high as 12 percent."Chanel "has also been in the news for its aggressive price hikes of iconic bags during the pandemic and more so recently," the analysts said."While not every luxury brand can pull off this double-edged sword, we believe Chanel's pricing actions have probably created a good space for the likes of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci to raise their price points further."Back in November, consultancy firm Bain & Company forecast that the luxury goods sector would grow by 6.0-8.0 percent annually and expand to 360-380 billion euros by 2025.Nevertheless, Flornoy fund manager Arnaud Cadart cautioned that raising prices too sharply could hurt sales."There are limits," he said. "A 1,000-euro bag that costs 1,200 euros the next day, that can slow down demand."
