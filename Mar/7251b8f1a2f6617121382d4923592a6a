The shooting happened as thousands of demonstrators tried to cross the bridge across the Nile linking the city to Khartoum.More than 2,000 protesters have been injured since October, medics say, while the UN has said at least 13 protesters were raped.Last week, United Nations rights expert Adama Dieng, during a mission to Sudan, expressed concern "about the violations [committed by] the authorities and the use of live ammunition against protesters."Both the UN and the US have made similar appeals before, with Washington threatening further "consequences" if violence continues. The coup, Sudan's latest, has already led to suspension of international aid.Sudanese authorities have said they arrested several police and soldiers who fired at demonstrators with Kalashnikov rifles, disobeying orders.Earlier in February, Human Rights Watch quoted witnesses detailing how the security forces have used both "live ammunition" and fired tear gas canisters "directly" at crowds, a tactic that can be deadly at close quarters.The coup derailed a fragile power-sharing arrangement between the army and civilians negotiated after the 2019 ouster of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.In Wad Madani, about 200 kilometers south of Khartoum, around 4,000 demonstrators took to the streets on Monday."Power to the people," they chanted, witnesses said. AFP
