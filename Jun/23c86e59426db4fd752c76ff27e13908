With temperatures far above the cows' "ideal climate" of 22-24 C, animals were drinking up to 140 liters of water per day, double their normal intake, and producing less due to stress, it said."As a result of climate change, heat waves are starting earlier," said Clare Nullis, a spokesperson for the World Meteorological Organization."What we're witnessing today is unfortunately a foretaste of the future" if concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to rise and push global warming toward 2 C from pre-industrial levels, she added.
