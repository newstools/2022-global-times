That mentality is improper," Lan Jianxue, head of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Saturday.

China and India should forge a cooperation model with a healthy interaction, so as to achieve mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation at a higher level and in a wider range, Wang said.Both countries should take part in the multilateral process with a cooperative posture. The two sides should step up communication, coordination and mutual support to send more positive signals for upholding multilateralism and inject more positive energy into improving global governance, Wang said.This approach is in line with the "three dos and three don'ts" for China-India relations Wang put forward in 2021. Wang hopes that China-India relations can overcome the negative impact of the Galwan Valley conflict, so that both sides can devote more energy to other urgent tasks, Lan said.If India can follow China's approach, viewing the border dispute in a pragmatic and rational way, and focusing its efforts on promoting the common interests of the two countries and seeking common ground, bilateral relations between the two countries will go more smoothly.  China-India relations are very promising, but India should adjust some of its thoughts, Lan noted.Wang's trip to India as well as his three-point approach can help improve China-India ties. Against a backdrop of the Ukraine crisis, failing global governance and emerging economies battered by COVID-19, if Beijing and New Delhi can refocus on cooperation, both countries will heavily benefit from it, according to experts. "China has made great efforts in this regard and has taken the first step and it is believed that India will follow suit. The smooth exchanges between the two countries will help them reach a bigger consensus on regional hotspot issues in their following meetings such as BRICS and SCO summits," Lan said.
