Workers install solar panels at a solar power plant in Lianyungang, East China's Jiangsu Province on Tuesday. The plant is being built over fish ponds, as part of an innovative photovoltaic demonstration projects. Once completed, it will have an installed capacity of 200 megawatts.

Running over 2,500 kilometers through 81 cities in five states from north to south, the project involves the world's longest ±800kV ultra-high-voltage direct current transmission line that offers clean electricity to over 20 million locals.In the digital field, the group has drawn up the BRICS Digital Economy Partnership Framework, emphasizing the commonalities and complementarities of BRICS members in the digital economy, while stressing the need to explore ways to leverage digital opportunities, accelerate digital transformation and create new drivers for sustainable development.A report released by the Shanghai-based Fudan Development Institute at Fudan University on Tuesday pointed out that BRICS members should strengthen cooperation in terms of promoting digital infrastructure, improving digital trade governance and promoting the nurture of digital talent, among others, to inject sustainable momentum into the BRICS' own economic recovery and that of the world.The digital economy - represented by cross-border e-commerce - has become a new highlight of economic and trade cooperation within the BRICS framework. Chinese official data showed that China's trade with other BRICS countries grew 12.1 percent year-on-year in the first five months, higher than the country's overall foreign trade growth rate.Upholding the concept of openness, non-BRICS countries have been invited to the meeting for dialogue and exchanges since 2013.As an innovative model of international cooperation, the "BRICS Plus" is a pragmatic arrangement that maintains resilience and flexibility, boosting all parties' participation in international cooperation in a comfortable way, said Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University.Shen said that the "BRICS Plus" system offers an effective approach to tackle the problem of uneven economic development and unequal economic status between developed and developing countries. "Thanks to opportunities created by 'BRICS Plus' cooperation, emerging markets and developing countries will see their standing in the global economy elevated, which will also boost the optimization of their domestic economic structures and accordingly boost the evolution of the global market order," he said.A total of 13 non-BRICS countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Argentina, attended Wednesday's forum, with business groups expressing a strong willingness to boost cooperation with the bloc amid a volatile international environment and prolonged pandemic.Loh Wee Keng, chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China, said on Wednesday that members of the chamber, including some of their peers in Malaysia, have been hit hard by the pandemic. "Therefore, we hope that through forums like this [BRICS Business Forum], cooperation like this, we can strengthen our joint economic planning in the post-epidemic era," said Loh.In an example of BRICS' expanding cooperation with other emerging markets to tackle climate change and other global issues, Brazil-based mining giant Vale said its Indonesian branch PT Vale Indonesia Tbk entered into a framework cooperation agreement with China's Huayou Cobalt in April, to develop a high-pressure acid leaching processing facility in Pomalaa.To reduce their carbon footprint, the companies agreed not to use captive or dedicated coal-fired power plants for any power source for the purpose of the Pomalaa project.
