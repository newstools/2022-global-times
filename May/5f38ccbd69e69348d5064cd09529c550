Some were depicted wearing clothes mimicking the US national flag.The incident continued to ferment anger as the public uncovered more serious problems than just ugly figures. Photos of the textbooks showed boys seemingly wearing no pants and an explicitly depicted male reproductive organ. An illustration of children playing together depicted a boy putting his hands on a girl's breast and another pulling on a girl's skirt. A leaping girl's underwear was completely exposed in one picture."It is not about aesthetics ... (the illustrations) are disguised malice," one Weibo user commented.China's publishing regulations stipulate that publications aimed at minors shall not contain content that induces minors to imitate acts that violate social morality or commit crimes, or content that is harmful to their physical and mental health, such as horror or cruelty. Those who publish or import publications containing such content and violating the criminal law shall be investigated for criminal responsibility.Education is the foundation of the Chinese national rejuvenation, the Legal Daily stressed, warning that poisonous textbooks and picture books would come out again if the government did not get to the root of the problem and hold the relevant people accountable.Floods of netizens spontaneously joined in a campaign to report more problematic teaching materials for minors.

The publisher, Sichuan Children's Publishing House, responded to media by saying it has revised the illustrations before publication. However, some controversial pictures remained in the book. The publisher explained that the picture was retained for coherent context, and the woman's back was exposed to show a wound, which was not modified after communication with the author.A publishing house - Hangzhou Qihai Book Group - said on Sunday that given the recent controversy over textbook illustrations, all published children's picture books and comics were required to be fully examined. The publisher said it would thus delay the publication of new comics and sales of comic strip cards.The trending topic over the textbook scandal reflected the increasing attention paid to talent cultivation, Zhu Wei, vice director of the Communication Law Research Center at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Sunday.Textbook publishing must undergo strict management with high-level standards to make sure that they are suited to mainstream values and aesthetics, Zhu said.
