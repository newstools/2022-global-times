Having a mixed group of attack and transport helicopters for air patrols is a new achievement, CCTV reported.The Karakoram Mountains are very challenging, not only to people, but also to rotary-wing aircrafts because of the high altitude and thin air, observers said.The Z-10 attack helicopter’s routine deployment in high-altitude border patrols indicates that its engine is powerful enough to deal with the thin air, a Beijing-based military aviation expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity.Escorted by attack helicopters, transport helicopters will get more fire support and face fewer threats during border patrol missions, the expert said.The PLA border defense troops will be able to better safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity in the western, high-altitude border regions, the expert remarked.
