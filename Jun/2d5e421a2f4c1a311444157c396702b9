For instance, Hong Kong's stock market has seen significant growth, with market capitalization increasing significantly by 12 times to over HK$40 trillion, and the number of listed companies increasing from over 600 to over 2,500.The tremendous development has also benefited from Hong Kong's role as a bridge and testing ground linking the Chinese mainland with the world, as well as the dividends released by institutional innovation, said Chan.The State Council appointed the principal officials of the sixth-term government of the HKSAR on Sunday, with Chan appointed to continue to serve as financial secretary. Amid the complicated global financial situation and high inflation following a recent US rate hike, international economic development will be affected and may further weaken Hong Kong's export growth momentum, according to Chan.However, Hong Kong has a very strong buffer in response to the rate hike, with over HK$280 billion in interbank balances, while local banks are still healthy as to their liquidity positions, capital adequacy ratios and risk exposure to classified loans, Chan said on Thursday at a press briefing, adding that inflation in Hong Kong will remain moderate with an annual forecast of 2-2.1 percent.Hong Kong's economy has also been recovering steadily from recent COVID-19 disruptions, with the unemployment rate in Hong Kong from March to May dropped 0.3 percentage points to 5.1 percent. Global Times
