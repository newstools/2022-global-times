The country is home to two UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites: The Cultural Landscape and Archaeological Remains of the Bamiyan Valley and the Minaret of Jam. Though replete with rich cultural heritage, many countries along the Silk Road such as Afghanistan barely have frameworks in place to safeguard the preservation of said artifacts due to an expertise deficit and outdated technology and are in dire need of professional assistance, observes said, stressing such cooperative protections are valuable to both China and Afghanistan as the relics depict historical and cultural interactions among the region's civilizations. "With similar geographical conditions, the mature sets of conservation techniques and digital recording tools for earthen sites and murals in the Mogao Grottoes - a world cultural heritage site in Dunhuang - can be valuable for these countries," Zhang Xiaogang, the director of Archaeology Institute of Dunhuang Academy in Northwest China's Gansu Province, told the Global Times.Political observers said that the Taliban's shift in attitude toward cultural preservation may suggest that the Taliban is moving closer to becoming a "multicultural and inclusive government" that the international community has come to expect. Long-awaited rebootThe Taliban recently vowed to guard the ancient Buddha statues discovered early in 2010 by a contracted Chinese construction team at the Mes Aynak mine in rural Afghanistan. The Taliban's milder stance on the preservation of Buddhist culture has sparked hopes for restoring ruined Buddha statues in Afghanistan's Bamiyan Grottoes."The Bamiyan Grottoes are very similar to the Mogao Grottoes in Northwest China's Gansu Province as well as the Kumtura Thousand Buddha Caves in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. More than 750 Buddhist caves were hollowed out along the Bamiyan Cliff including the two most famous niches with giant Buddha statues (55m and 38m high) destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. These figurative murals had a profound influence not only on Chinese Buddhist art but also across the whole of East Asia in countries such as Japan and Korea," Chinese archaeologist Shao Xuecheng said in an online public speech in February. Shao has been to Bamiyan several times to study the local cultural relics.The study of Buddhist culture and art in Afghanistan and other surrounding areas helps us further understand the routes of Buddhism's spread, Zhang told the Global Times.Zhang noted that the restoration of the Bamiyan Buddhas is currently facing many challenges. However, he believes that there is still a great deal of investigation and conservation work to be done on the caves surrounding the Bamiyan Buddhas."With a strong yearning to understand the relics' glorious history and the culture of the region, and to better develop tourism, many local experts and scholars would like China to provide them with relevant research materials from the international academic community to help them understand when, by whom, and why the Bamiyan caves were built. What is the relationship between the Bamiyan caves and the Dunhuang Grottoes? They also hope Chinese scholars will collaborate with them to groom domestic research talent," Zhang told the Global Times.

The urgency around rebuilding the cultural relic protection system and the training of talents in the field is great, said Wang."Taking the National Museum of Afghanistan that is considered to be one of the world's greatest repositories of ancient cultures, where I recently visited, as an example, a large number of relics wait to be restored by just two experts. The extreme lack of personnel, investment, and experience are the main difficulties they face," said Wang, who visited Afghanistan in December 2021 and February this year respectively. Mohammad Fahim Rahimi, the director of the National Museum of Afghanistan, was highly impressed by China's advanced cultural relic protection system during his visits to China and hopes that China can offer more support and personnel exchanges opportunities in the future, Wang said.Open channelsThe inaugural cultural relic research trip led by a group of Chinese archaeologists from the Dunhuang Academy to Bamiyan was done at the end of March 2018.The delegation visited three caves in the Bamiyan Valley, Kakrak, and Foladi, and six ancient cities, pagodas, and monasteries in Kelligan, Tang-I Safedak, Chilborj, Zohak, and Gholghola, recalled Zhang, who was in the team."It was a friendly, introductory, and dream-fulfilling trip. During the expedition, we discovered that many of the sites were deep in inaccessible mountains. We often climbed high mountains and cliffs on our hands and knees. But whenever we saw a pagoda, a Buddhist temple site, a unique grotto, or a surviving mural, we were so excited that we forgot about how tired we were," Zhang said.Through the trip, the Chinese experts gained a deeper understanding of the status and preservation of the numerous archaeological sites in Bamiyan, the routes of how Buddhist culture spread in the region, and art along the Silk Road, and the similarities and differences between the Bamiyan Caves and the Dunhuang Grottoes, as well as their historical origins.Zhang noted that during their visit, the China Dunhuang Grottoes Conservation Research Foundation announced a $15,000 grant to the National Museum of Afghanistan and the Bamiyan to support mutual academic exchanges in the study of Silk Road history and cultural heritage conservation.As part of the Chinese commitment to help bolster local cultural relic conservation, the Academy also invited two professors from the Bamyan University for a research trip to Dunhuang to learn about the local heritage protection work.The scholarly and expertise exchange program under the agreements is expected to resume in the near future, Zhang noted.Positive signsUrgent calls to protect Afghan cultural workers and safeguard the country's cultural heritage were strong after the Taliban came to power in August 2021.Amid global concerns, the Taliban has vowed to protect local cultural heritage repositories as they posted a small group of armed guards outside the national museum, for example, to prevent looting in August 2021, according to the director, Mohammad Fahim Rahimi, the New York Times reported.The Taliban's positive response was seen as a sign that they are trying to move toward a more inclusive government, observers said."As far as I know, in 2019, the Taliban actually reached out to a number of foreign archaeologists and promised to support international cooperation in cultural heritage research. And fortunately, few reports of military attacks or the destruction of cultural heritage sites have been reported since the Taliban took power in August 2021," Shao suggested.
