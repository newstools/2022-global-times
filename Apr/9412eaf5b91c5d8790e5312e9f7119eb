First-quarter retail sales stood at 10.87 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion), up 3.3 percent year-on-year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed.The epidemic will have a short-term impact on consumption, but it will not have a big impact in the long run, Cong Yi, professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Monday, adding that consumption will soon bounce back after the epidemic eases."To achieve the consumption rebound, China's 'dynamic zero-COVID policy' must be enforced swiftly to bring the latest outbreak of COVID-19 under control," Cong said.On the whole, the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain sound in the long run, and the potential and resilience of the consumer market remain unchanged, Cong said.In order to boost consumption in the long run, the guidelines issued by the State Council call for unleashing consumption potential through creation and consumption upgrading, such as tapping the growth potential in healthcare, eldercare and childcare, expanding the consumption in culture and tourism, vigorously developing green consumption, and tapping the consumption potential at the countryside and township levels."In the long run, policies to boost consumption cover a wide range of areas, and there is still great potential for unleashing the potential of domestic demand," Cong said.
