He accused protest organizers of "hiding behind false slogans" and trying to "seize the buildings of local government bodies."Uzbekistan's parliament has voted to extend a period of public discussion on the draft constitutional law for another 10 days until July 15, lawmaker Bobur Bekmurodov announced on Twitter on Monday. The constitutional right of the autonomous republic to break away from Uzbekistan is a legacy of an agreement struck between Karakalpakstan and the central government in Tashkent after the collapse of the Soviet Union.One amendment set to remain in the draft document will allow presidents to run for seven-year terms, directly benefitting Mirziyoyev, who crushed token opponents to secure a second five-year term in October 2021.The Uzbek Embassy in Beijing told the Global Times on Monday that Mirziyoyev mentioned the constitutional reform is an issue of utmost importance for the present and future of the country."In short, this process will go on for as long as it takes to update the Constitution. In that pursuit, we will act only in consultation with our people," Mirziyoyev said.
