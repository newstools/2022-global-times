Those found guilty of committing a crime will be held criminally responsible in accordance with the law.Experts said that as the country is launching a normal testing mechanism, private testing facilities still needed to meet the large demand for nucleic acid testing and it is urgent to strengthen the management of these facilities.Global Times
