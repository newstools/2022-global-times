Illustration: Xia Qing/GTWhen shopping, especially for food, most consumers are accustomed to looking for the production date of the items. But in some cases, it's difficult to find the date on the package. When we finally find it, it's sometimes not clear enough to discern. Looking for the production date is like testing eyesight. No wonder some seniors shop with a magnifying glass. Whether it is deliberately made or unintentional, it has inconvenienced consumers. An honest enterprise should put key information like production dates in a prominent position. From the perspective of ensuring food security, it's important to establish a set of rules and standards for the production date, including its position on the package, font size and color.
