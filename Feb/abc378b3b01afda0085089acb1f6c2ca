But he added that there were suspicions of involvement by "outside groups," without elaborating.The armed forces were committed to handing over power to an elected government or to an arrangement decided through "national consensus," he said, repeating a commitment to holding elections in mid-2023.The military had met resistance committees that are leading the protest movement, and they agreed on many points, he said. In statements, resistance committees have rejected dialogue with the military.Prior to the coup, the military had led steps to reach an agreement in late 2020 to normalize relations with Israel, a move also made by the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco.Burhan said meetings between Israeli and Sudanese officials since the coup had not been high-level and only involved the security and intelligence apparatus."This is a legitimate matter for these agencies, and it is no secret that the information shared enabled us to catch several terrorist organizations located inside Sudan," he said.Protesters have accused the military of bringing back loyalists of ousted president Omar al-Bashir. In response, Burhan said officials appointed since the takeover were already part of civil service, and that the committee had diverged from its goals though he was not involved in the arrests.AFP
