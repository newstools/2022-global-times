China India Photo:CFPChina and India should treat each other as partners of mutual success rather than adversaries of mutual attrition, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a press conference on Monday, noting that the two countries should not allow territorial disputes left over from history to affect the overall interests of bilateral cooperation. Wang made the remarks at Monday's press conference on China's foreign policy and foreign relations via video link on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress. When asked about the future of China-India relations given that the bilateral relations have been in the doldrums for the past three years, Wang said the two sides should stick to the strategic consensus of "not posing threats but providing mutual development opportunities to each other," and enhance mutual trust and avoid misunderstandings."China-India relations have suffered some setbacks in recent years, which does not serve the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples," he said. As for the border disputes left over from history, China always advocates managing differences through equal consultation and actively seeking a just and reasonable solution, said Wang, adding that these historical issues should not be allowed to affect or interfere with the relations of the two countries, especially the overall interests of bilateral cooperation.Wang pointed out that there are some forces trying to stir up conflicts between China and India and create division in the region. However, more people have realized that for big countries like China and India with over a billion people, only by upholding independent principles can the two truly decide their destinies and achieve revitalization.With a combined population of more than 2.8 billion, one third of the global total, China and India can contribute to global peace and prosperity by developing stably and living in harmony, said Wang. "Just as an Indian saying goes - help thy brother's boat across, and lo! thine own has reached the shore," he said, noting that the two countries should treat each other as partners of mutual success rather than adversaries of mutual attrition.
