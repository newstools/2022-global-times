It subsequently accused France of spying and attempting to sully the reputation of Malian forces with the drone-filmed video."The said drone was present... to spy on our brave FAMa [Malian armed forces]," government spokesperson Abdoulaye Maiga said. "In addition to the spying, French forces were guilty of subversion by publishing false images worked up to accuse the FAMa of responsibility for killing civilians, with the aim of tarnishing their image."Bamako said "foreign aircraft, notably operated by French forces" had deliberately violated Malian airspace more than 50 times since the start of 2022.France, Mali's former colonial power, is winding down its almost decade-long, anti-jihadist military operation in the West African state. But in February, it decided to pull out its troops after falling out with the military junta.AFP
