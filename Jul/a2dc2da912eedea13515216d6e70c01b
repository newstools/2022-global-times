Officials say 307 illegal cases were detected, 558 suspects and 135 criminals at large were arrested.The 100-day campaign called up by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) was launched in the wake of the brutality at a restaurant in the city of Tangshan.A dispatch meeting held by the Hebei provincial public security department on Tuesday revealed that since the campaign was launched, 307 illegal cases were detected, 558 suspects and 135 criminals at large were arrested in Hebei Province.The meeting clarified the next focal point of the campaign. It said, "it is important to focus on crimes involving gangs, crimes against vulnerable groups, as well as crimes of provoking trouble, and fraud crimes against the elderly, that seriously infringe on people's sense of security and challenge the bottom line of psychology."The MPS previously said illegal behaviors that infringe on the rights of children and women will be given extra attention.The 100-day campaign was launched across China since the MPS held a mobilization meeting on June 25.The MPS stressed the need to strengthen the allocation of police forces on streets, communities and patrols at night, so as to safeguard security of the society and guarantee the public's wellbeing.Actually, ever since the brutal assault at the Tangshan restaurant on June 10, special campaigns on inspecting potential crimes at night markets, shopping malls and barbecue stalls have also sprung up in multiple cities including Baoding, Qinhuangdao in Hebei and many more provinces.Prior to the 100-day campaign, Tangshan had just finished its 15-day "Thunderstorm" campaign. It was a direct response to the impact on the society of the shocking assault at a barbecue restaurant which involved nine suspects insulting and beating up four women at midnight.Global Times
