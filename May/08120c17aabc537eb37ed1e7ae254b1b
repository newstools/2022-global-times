In 1941 when Japanese invaders occupy Shanghai, the father is killed for supporting patriotic anti-invasion activities and refusing to kowtow to the occupiers. In order to realize their father's wish of rejuvenating the country through industry, the three women finally unite and overcome difficulties together.Wu is no stranger to shows focusing on the power of women as she is appearing in the third season of Sisters Who Make Waves on Mango TV, which gathers Chinese female entertainers together and allows them to show off their talents. She said that while she was on the show, she saw the various charms possessed by women and is trying to challenge herself to make a breakthrough."I think the two shows are similar in that the women in both are all uniting together to fight against difficulties and fulfill a unified goal," Wu said.Family cultureWang Wei, director of the series which is aired at China's streaming platform Youku, said that Chinese "family culture" is another focus of the work and that this can be reflected in its Chinese title, Chuanjia (lit: Pass down through the family)"This also refers to passing on love. This love includes love between relatives and love of the motherland. Audiences can understand Chinese people's views on love through the series," Wang said."We hope that the hard work and self-created business of fathers can be passed down from generation to generation like our family now, but sometimes it can be more than a business. It can be a family belief or spiritual heritage," a Chinese netizen commented in a review of the show on Chinese media review platform Douban.To better recreate the atmosphere of the times, the production team spent around five months building sets for the Yi family house and four months for the department store.Costumes are another highlight. The production team designed various cheongsam, a kind of traditional Chinese dress, for the three female characters to show their different personalities. For example, Wu's clothing includes works of modern art because of her educational background.
