In particular, since the beginning of this year, the epidemic situation in China's neighboring countries and regions has been increasingly volatile. Since March this year, the average number of daily imported cases in China has exceeded 200.From March 1 to 18, more than 29,000 COVID-19 cases were reported across 28 provinces and regions in China, including more than 10,000 cases in one province of Jilin, according to officials at the press conference.As of the end of Friday, 29,127 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been hospitalized nationwide, with more than 95 percent considered mild or asymptomatic cases. The proportion of severe and critical cases is less than 5 percent, one NHC official said."On the whole, the local epidemic situation in China is still in the development stage, and many provinces and regions are fighting against the Omicron epidemic in multiple cities at the same time." the official said, noting that the national epidemic prevention and control situation remains grim and complex."Epidemic prevention and control is a priority for the country," Mi Feng, a spokesperson from the NHC, said. While stressing the precise anti-epidemic work under the dynamic zero-COVID policy, Mi requested that the public and the relevant departments resist a "relax, rest, wait and see," attitude and not show fatigue in the face of the epidemic battle, no fluking, slacking, noting persistence is victory.

If we are vaccinated with the booster, we can also effectively reduce the risk of breakout infection caused by the new variant. Therefore, existing vaccines and booster shots are still effective against the Omicron variant, Zheng Zhongwei, another official of the NHC and an expert on vaccine, said at the press conference.More than 1.239 billion Chinese, or 87.85 percent of China's total population, have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Friday, according to the NHC. However, 52 million people aged 60 and above have not been fully vaccinated, and the proportion of the group with full vaccination and booster is low.Of the two new deaths reported on Friday in Northeast China's Jilin Province, one was at advanced age and the other was over 60 years old, both with serious underlying health problems. One of them had not been vaccinated, according to the NHC at the press conference.Both patients showed only mild COVID-19 symptoms and the immediate cause of death was due to their underlying diseases, said the NHC official.Citing global statistics which showed that the average age of death of COVID-19 patients is over 70 years old, the NHC stressed the rate of vaccination among the elderly should be further raised.
