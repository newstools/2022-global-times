Protesters are seen outside of the US Supreme Court in Washington DC on November 1, 2021. The Supreme Court was set to hear challenges to Texas' restrictive abortion laws.

"But imagine, if you will, try[ing] to increase your staff in the middle of a pandemic, when medical personnel are already overtaxed, and stressed and unavailable."Before Texas' new law limiting abortion rights, only 18 percent of patients in the clinic came from Texas. Now, they represent the majority.But Louisiana residents are also continuing to seek abortions, so they too must suffer through the delays caused by the new Texas law.As far as Colorado and Oklahoma "She learned she was pregnant a month and a half ago," says an African-American woman, 34, motioning to her 16-year-old daughter, sitting next to her in the waiting room, wrapped in a blanket.Sitting a few seats over, two other African-American women from Houston and Dallas wait their turn.The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research organization, reported in 2008 that the abortion rate in America for black women was almost five times higher than that of white women.While often hoping to maintain their privacy, these Texas women dealt with several rounds of logistical difficulties to make both of their out-of-state appointments: finding childcare, taking time off work, sometimes renting a car, and paying for lodging.They also had to find a confidant who could also take off work and travel with them.Before a spot opened up in Louisiana, Shayla was on waiting lists in Colorado and Oklahoma."It's like, either have a baby and struggle, or travel," explains the 27-year-old Houstonian, who is already a single mother to a 2-year-old son.She says that two organizations helped her raise the $2,000 she needed for the whole process, including the $695 fee for the abortion.She notes that the difficulty in finding stable childcare was a major factor in her decision to terminate her pregnancy."Maybe somebody can watch your baby one day and somebody can't the next... How [are] you gonna maintain a job like that?" she asks, as her mother and son wait outside."And so I was like... I'm not gonna have two kids and struggle even worse."AFP
