Journalists escort the body of veteran Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was shot dead by Israeli troops as she covered a raid on the West Bank's Jenin refugee camp on May 11, 2022, at the hospital in Jenin. Al Jazeera's Nida Ibrahim said Abu Akleh was a "very well respected journalist" who has been working with Al Jazeera since the beginning of the second Palestinian Intifada in 2000.
