It is foreseeable that more firms will join the transfer league in the future, experts said.Highbroad Advanced Material (Hefei) Co and Shiyan Taixiang Industry Co are now planning such transfers, but unlike Skycam Defense, the two companies are heading for the ChiNext for listing.The newly established BSE started trading in November last year, a key step in China's efforts to deepen capital market reform and support small businesses.In the latest efforts to support SMEs, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council said in a statement on Wednesday that centrally administered enterprises should speed up original technology innovations, work with various entities including SMEs to tackle key problems, and help the industrial chain and supply chain.
