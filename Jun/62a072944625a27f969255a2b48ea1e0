Photo: VCGA six-month-long nationwide campaign was launched by the Bureau of Network Security Protection under the Ministry of Public Security on Sunday to crack down on internet water armies, who have been attempting to control or disrupt online public opinions through releasing fake and harmful information. Based on the "Clean up the Internet" campaign, the cybersecurity bureau has handled 600 or so cases and arrested more than 4,000 suspects over the past three years, officials said. Nevertheless, allured by network flow and the booming of"fan economy," paid posters never stopped their illegal and criminal activities online despite repeated prohibitions. To make more profits, some water armies attempt to manipulate or disturb online public opinions through clout-chasing behaviors by releasing illegal or harmful information. Some posters use fake information to exert extortion and infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of the public. Others provide services of paid post deletions, click farming, comment control and speculation that undermine the market economy and social management orders. Disturbed by the water armies'activities, the public and media have put forward reports, proposals and motions during the two sessions to tackle the problem. In response to public concerns and curb the spread of the "network water army" and related dark and grey industries, the bureau launched the campaign to safeguard the internet ecosystem, the order of the market economy, and the legitimate rights and interests of the public. Besides, the cybersecurity bureau will cooperate with related departments and strengthen coordination to crack down on relevant illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the laws. Global Times
