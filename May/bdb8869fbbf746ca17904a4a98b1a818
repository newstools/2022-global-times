Upgrading of passenger facilities in the Anduo, Naqu and Dangxiong stations will also be undertaken. Analysts said that the transformation will play an indispensable role in the economic and social development of areas along the section of the line, as the transportation efficiency will be increased, and the transformation will help promote the development of clean energy and protect the environment of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau.Xiong Kunxin, a professor at the Minzu University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that the project will improve the logistics system in the area and promote connections with other provinces. Economic development will also get a boost, especially for industries like tourism.Data showed that as of the end of 2021, the Lhasa station had handled 30.97 million passenger trips and 71.19 million tons of cargo to and from Xizang since 2006, when the section was opened as the only railway transport channel connecting the region with other provinces.Electrifying the line will make the trains more efficient, as the electric locomotives will have more traction on the Xizang Plateau than the current internal combustion locomotives, and they will reduce pollution, Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, told the Global Times.
