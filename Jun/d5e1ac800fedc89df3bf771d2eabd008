Yemen's warring parties entered a two-month UN-brokered truce on April 2, which includes allowing commercial flights to and from the Houthi-held capital Sanaa and the entry of fuel ships into the Houthi-held port Hodeidah and lifting the siege of the government-held Taiz city.The warring parties have largely held the truce, but have yet to reach a final agreement on lifting the siege of Taiz.On Tuesday, the warring parties renewed the truce for another two months, allowing more time for them to sort out persisting disagreements.Yemen fell into a civil war in late 2014 when the Iran-backed Houthi militia seized control of several northern provinces and forced the Saudi-backed Yemeni government out of Sanaa.Xinhua
