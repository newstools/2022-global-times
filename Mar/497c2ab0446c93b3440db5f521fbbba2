You hear some pretty bad media and that is completely false," he said.China's State Council released the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for the Tourism Industry in January, saying the country will adjust policies related to exchanges of inbound and outbound tourists on the basis of ensuring pandemic prevention.Huang suggested that related governments should come up with detailed measures in optimizing visa policies, entry requirements, remote payments and internet service, to prepare for resuming inbound tourism. The outbound tourism industry has to make changes to adapt to the normalized COVID-19 prevention and control, Huang said. The international community should discuss the mutual recognition of nucleic acid testing results and COVID-19 vaccine to establish an international health code system for travel, Huang said.
