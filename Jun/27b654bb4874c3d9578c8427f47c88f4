Xiao and other three martyrs sacrificed their lives in the deadly Galwan Valley border clash with Indian troops about two years ago.As parents of one of the Galwan Valley heroes, Xiao Shengsong and Liu Lixia do not want to bother anyone despite many people, including volunteers and Xiao's comrade-in-arms and classmates, came to the couple to care for them and offer their help for the wheat harvest."We do not want to bother others." So, the couple decided to harvest the wheat by themselves. The couple got up early and started the work at 4:00 am on Sunday and finished harvesting all the six mu (about 0.4 hectares) of wheat about one and a half hours later, the Henan Daily reported on Monday. Early at 8:00 am on Sunday in Yanjin county, Henan Province, nine soldiers led by Dong Xingjun came to the field to help harvesting the wheat but they were surprised when they found that all the grain had been picked, the report said."Since you insisted on coming, I decided to get up early," Xiao smiled, noting that this year's wheat harvest is good.Dong was moved and said they would help delivering the grain.People have never forgotten the hero's parents and the couple have always remembered the people's care for them. They decided to send their younger son, 18-year-old Xiao Rongji, to the army. It is their son's responsibility to safeguard the country and their own duty to farm well as farmers, the couple said according to the report.
