He accused European countries of applying "double standards," given the groups were subject to Interpol-issued worldwide requests to detain their members.Copenhagen has accused Tehran of a plot to eliminate the senior ASMLA official, in retaliation for a September 2018 attack in Ahvaz, capital of Iran's southwestern Khuzestan province, that left 24 people dead.Tehran at the time accused Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain of harboring members of the group, which Iran accused of being responsible for the attack in Ahvaz.AFP
