Israel also normalized ties with the UAE in 2020.Speaking to reporters before take-off, Bennett said he hoped the visit would be a "message of goodwill... and a shared stance against common threats."Israel has stepped up cooperation with the Gulf states. Manama hosted Israel's defense minister on February 2 and has said an Israeli military officer will be posted in Bahrain as part of an international coalition. The outreach by Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarch has been criticized by an opposition led by the Shi'ite majority. The country has seen protests in solidarity with the Palestinians.There were brief protests in several Shi'ite villages ahead of Bennett's visit, activists told Reuters. Reuters
