The envoy was handed an official protest letter which said "Qatar is expecting a public apology and immediate condemnation of these remarks from the government of India," according to a foreign ministry statement."Allowing such Islamophobic remarks to continue without punishment constitutes a grave danger to the protection of human rights" and "will create a cycle of violence and hate," it added.Earlier Sunday, neighboring Kuwait said that, like Qatar, it had summoned India's ambassador, amid widespread calls on social media for a boycott of Indian goods in the Gulf.The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), based in the Saudi city of Jeddah, also condemned the remarks Sunday, saying they came in a "context of intensifying hatred and abuse towards Islam in India and systematic practices against Muslims."India's BJP on Sunday suspended Sharma for expressing "views contrary to the party's position." Modi's party, which has frequently been accused of acting against the country's Muslim minority, said it "respects all religions." AFP
