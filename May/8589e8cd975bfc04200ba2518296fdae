But the historical wheel of national reunification and rejuvenation cannot be stopped, said China's top political advisor Wang Yang on Wednesday.Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the fifth cross-Straits Youth Development Forum, themed "Join Hands for a Better Life," which was launched in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province.Hung Hsiu-chu, a former head of the Kuomintang, and chairman of the Chinese Cyan Geese Peace Education Foundation, attended the forum upon invitation. About 450 people, including young representatives from both sides of the Straits, attended the forum.Hung said that the integration of Chinese mainland and Taiwan island is an irresistible historical trend, and the countercurrent of Taiwan independence cannot shake this mighty historical trend after all. "As long as we never give up, we will surely open up a bright road for the integration of the two sides and the rejuvenation of the nation in the future," Hung noted.Wang stressed that peace, development and a better life are the common aspirations of compatriots in the island of Taiwan, and creating a better life is the common pursuit of compatriots on both sides of the Straits.The first cross-Straits Youth Development Forum was held as a new platform for cross-Straits youth exchange and cooperation in 2018. After its creation, the Forum attracted the attention of people from all walks of life on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Since then the Forum has been held every year as promised.The head of Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council Liu Jieyi delivered a speech during the Forum in which he said that the Taiwan independence and secessionist forces are attempting in vain to interfere with the reunification process of the motherland and are seriously harming the vital interests of compatriots in peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits."Young people in Taiwan should have a clear understanding of the situation, resolutely oppose secessionists and foreign interference, and devote themselves to realizing the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland," Liu said.Liu also pointed out that East China's Zhejiang Province is an area of high-quality development and prosperity and has close economic and trade exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan island. It is hoped that the majority of young people on the island will seize the opportunity to lead towards and actively participate in the cooperation between Zhejiang and Taiwan."The Chinese mainland has successfully achieved the first centenary goal - building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and is now moving resolutely toward the second. This will provide room for compatriots on both sides of the Straits, especially young people, to join their hands and proceed ahead," Wang said.Wang added that it is hoped that young people on the island of Taiwan will keep the overall situation in mind and uphold justice: "They should firmly oppose 'Taiwan secessionists' and interference by external forces, stand up for their own interests and well-being, and have the courage to pursue a better life, so as to contribute in better ways to the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, to the great cause of reunification and to national rejuvenation."Global Times
