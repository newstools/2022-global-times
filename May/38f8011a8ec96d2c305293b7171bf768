The city's merchandise exports declined 4.5 percent, per the Tuesday announcement. Retail sales plunged 13.8 percent in March and the first-quarter reading slid 7.6 percent, Chan disclosed in his blog on Sunday. The catering sector was even harder-hit, with local restaurants recording revenues of HK$3.93 billion ($500.65 million) in March, the lowest monthly tally on record. The first-quarter number totaled HK$15.1 billion, the lowest in nearly 16 years.All this shows the huge impact on the local economy from the peak of the fifth wave of the coronavirus, Chan wrote.Growth will improve along with the gradual containment of the virus and the recovery of local economic activity. Nonetheless, it will still take time for the economy to reboot internally while the external environment remains elusive, he continued.The US Federal Reserve's rate hike decision last week, the sharpest in 22 years with half a percentage increase in its key funds rate, and rate hikes of 25 basis points by both the UK and Australian central banks, were enumerated among external uncertainties."We're re-examining the economic growth forecast and will release the latest forecast next week. Currently, it seems a downward revision is inevitable," Chan said.In his budget address in February, Chan put the city's economic growth at a range of 2-3.5 percent in real terms this year. The HKSAR's economy expanded 6.4 percent in 2021.Hong Kong's economy is fairly internationalized, subject to the pandemic evolution and global economic fluctuations, Tian Feilong, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.Tian was upbeat on a turnaround in the local economy as he derived confidence from the newly elected chief executive designate.By securing 99.16 percent support in voting on Sunday, John Lee Ka-chiu was chosen as the sixth-term chief executive designate of the HKSAR.A push for improved regional and international competitiveness of Hong Kong is a highlight of Lee's policy agenda, Tian said."The election of the new chief executive, exemplifying patriots governing Hong Kong, would tremendously ease the city's internal frictions and gather strength for its economic rebooting," he said.Lee was formerly Hong Kong's chief secretary for administration. Sunday's chief executive election was the first since the improvement to the HKSAR's electoral system have been implemented.Hong Kong's is expected to explore new paths for growth beyond its traditional industries, the expert stressed, betting on the city's closer connectivity with the Chinese mainland through the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area initiative to enable new growth engines for its economy.
