Rescuers are searching for the 3-year-old boy who fell into sewer drain through a manhole and was swept away in Xi'an, the capital city of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, May 15, 2022. From: CCTV NewsRescuers are still searching for the 3-year-old boy who fell into sewer drain through a manhole and was swept away on Thursday evening in Xi'an, the capital city of Northwest China's Shaanxi Province. The rescue efforts have been going on for more than 60 hours.Rescuers got down to the sewer drain to search for the missing boy along the sewer system. They have reached a sewage treatment plant by Sunday noon, four kilometers away from the manhole the boy fell into.The manhole is on a main road where many local people usually travel. The boy's parents told media that there was no cover on the manhole on that raining evening when they took their 3-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter back home. The boy's father could see his son at the bottom of the shaft after the accidents, but only found the boy washed by the water to a smaller pipe beyond his reach when he climbed down into the shaft. The father then called the police and local authorities immediately formed a rescue team consisting of two sewer system experts, two divers and more than 30 professional rescuers. The removal of the sewer cover is still under investigation as it could have been flushed away by the rain or it may have been moved deliberately for draining the water off the street.
