It was absolutely terrifying," Good, 23, told Sky News, adding that none of the occupants was injured.The train network in the Netherlands was paralyzed, with no Eurostar and Thalys international services running from Britain and France after damage to overhead power lines.France and Ireland were also grappling with rail disruption and power cuts, and Germany's rail operator Deutsche Bahn said "more than 1,000 kilometers" of track had suffered damage.Poland still had 1.2 million customers without electricity on Saturday afternoon, officials said, after the country's northwest took a battering."I appeal to you: Please stay at home!" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a Facebook post."We are constantly monitoring the situation and the appropriate services are at work. The fire brigade has already intervened more than 12,000 times," he said in a statement.In the UK, 226,000 homes and businesses remained without power after 1.2 million others were reconnected. The toll so far includes four each in the Netherlands and Poland; three in the UK, two dead each in Belgium and Germany, and one in Ireland.Around 30 people in northern France were injured in storm-related road accidents, and in the Netherlands, dozens of people had to be evacuated from their homes because of fears that a church's clock tower might collapse.Eunice sparked the first-ever "red" weather warning for London on Friday. It was one of the most powerful tempests in Europe since the "Great Storm" hit Britain and northern France in 1987.Scientists said both storms packed a "sting jet," a rarely seen meteorological phenomenon borne out of an unusual confluence of pressure systems in the Atlantic that magnified the effects of Eunice.The Met Office, Britain's meteorological service, on Saturday issued a less severe "yellow" wind warning for much of the south coast of England and South Wales, which it said "could hamper recovery efforts from Storm Eunice."The UK's total bill for damage could exceed £300 million ($410 million), according to the Association of British Insurers, based on repairs from previous storms.AFP
