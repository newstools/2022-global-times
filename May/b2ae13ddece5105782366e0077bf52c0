Photos attached to the release show that the J-15 fighter jets carried missiles under their wings.Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force dispatched its de facto aircraft carrier, the Izumo, to gather intelligence and monitor the activities of the Chinese vessels, the press release said, noting that Japan also sortied fighter jets to "deal with" the J-15s.The Japanese press release came after Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng, a spokesperson of the PLA Navy said on Tuesday that the PLA Navy sent the Liaoning aircraft carrier group to conduct realistic combat training in the far sea of the West Pacific.The exercise is a routine one organized according to the annual schedule and is aimed at boosting the Navy's capabilities to carry out its duties, Gao said, noting that the voyage is in line with related international law and practice and is not targeted at another party.Analysts said that far sea exercises have already become routine for the Liaoning, as the PLA Navy is making strides to become a deep-blue navy.In addition to the Japanese de facto aircraft carrier Izumo, the US Navy's Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was also operating in the Philippines Sea at least as of Monday, according to the Fleet and Marine Tracker by the news website of the US Naval Institute.It is almost certain that Japanese and US warships and warplanes will conduct close-in reconnaissance attempts and make some provocative moves on the Chinese flotilla, so the Chinese vessels and vessel-based aircraft must have been well prepared to confidently deal with them, experts told the Global Times.
