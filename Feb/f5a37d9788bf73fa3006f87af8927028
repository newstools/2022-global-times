"I think that this is an act of xenophobia against us."Costa Rica's embassy in Cuba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Costa Rican authorities have previously said the decision to require the transit visa was aimed at assuring "orderly and dignified migration." All the Cubans interviewed by Reuters at the embassy on Monday said they were traveling to Nicaragua to shop or for tourism.Air ticket prices to the Central American nation have more than tripled to as much as $3,500 in the three months since Nicaragua lifted the visa requirement for Cubans, according to posts on classified service Revolico and several of those interviewed by Reuters at the embassy. That is several times the average annual salary in Cuba.Reuters
