Social media posts showed inundated houses and debris, including bins, boats and cars, floating down roads.In the northern NSW city of Lismore, the entire CBD was underwater and the Bureau of Meteorology warned the city's Wilsons River could reach around 14.2 meters on Monday afternoon, surpassing the last peak back in 1954."I have been fielding calls from very distressed residents who are sitting on rooftops trying to get help. It's diabolical," Lismore Mayor Steve Krieg told broadcaster ABC. Krieg said the sheer speed of rising waters caught people by surprise as he urged the town's near 30,000 residents to leave their homes immediately.Lismore resident Kara Ahearn said she, her partner and three children were rescued by a kayaker from their roof, to where they had fled when their house was inundated within two hours."Very intense morning... very shaken," she told ABC. "We had to leave our pets behind... we didn't even have time to put our shoes on."Australia's east coast summer has been dominated by the La Nina climate pattern, which is typically associated with greater rainfall, for the second straight year.Several regions have seen rainfall records for February broken because of the relentless downpour, with some places getting more than a month's or more than a year's rain in one day.Many of the nine fatalities were people who had attempted to cross flooded roads, either by foot or in a vehicle, including one man who was found in a submerged car on Monday morning with his deceased dog."We say this every time during flooding events," Perrottet said. "If you drive through floodwaters, you are putting your life, and the lives of others, at risk."Reuters
