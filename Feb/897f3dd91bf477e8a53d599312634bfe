They want the so-called "conditionality mechanism" to be invalidated.But in December the court's advisor, the advocate general, concluded that the Polish-Hungarian challenge should be rejected, arguing that the conditionality mechanism was compatible with the EU's treaties.Should the judges decide the same, it would open the door to the European Commission cutting their funding.The European Parliament, which approves the EU's multi-year budgets, has for months called for the commission to do just that, stressing that the conditionality instrument has been available since the beginning of 2021.It has even launched its own legal action, accusing the commission of inaction.But the EU executive, wary of being wrong-footed by court rulings and aware it needs a qualified majority of member states to approve the mechanism's use, has been determined to build a cast-iron case, step-by-step.In November, it sent formal letters to Warsaw and Budapest setting out what it sees as the democratic shortfalls.For Poland, it criticizes judicial reforms it believes undermine judges' independence and a refusal to accept the primacy of EU law over Polish law.For Hungary, it is about public procurement, conflict of interests and corruption.That decision would then be debated in the European Parliament, where EU budget commissioner Johannes Hahn is expected to stand in for commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who pulled out to focus on the military crisis over Ukraine.If the ECJ confirms the right to cut money on these grounds, "we expect the European Commission to start putting the mechanism into action right away," said the head of the conservative EPP bloc in the parliament, Manfred Weber.AFP
