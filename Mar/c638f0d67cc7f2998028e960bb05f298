American truck drivers prepare to leave for Washington, DC to protest COVID-19 mandates on February 22, 2022 in Adelanto, California, to call for a full re-opening of the country. US daily new cases dropped below 100,000 in the past week, for the first time in three months.

President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signaled in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that the country was entering a new, more controlled phase of the pandemic without business lockdowns or school closures.Still, more than 100 18-wheeler trucks amassed with other vehicles on Friday evening at the Hagerstown Speedway, a racetrack about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from downtown Washington, according to Reuters witnesses. Drivers continued to stream into the parking lot on Saturday morning, one witness said.A website for the protest said they did not plan to enter the "DC proper" and social media posts suggested they could remain at the racetrack on Saturday. But one participant who described himself as the lead trucker told a cheering crowd at the racetrack on Friday night that he would drive his truck into the heart of the American capital."DC, the government, whomever, can claim that they have all this opposition for us waiting in DC," the man said. "But that flag on the back of my truck will go down to Constitution Avenue between the White House and the Washington Monument."A little more than a year ago, supporters of former president Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in an attack that left five people dead and more than 100 police officers injured. US federal law enforcement agencies have been coordinating with state and local authorities for weeks in preparation for the possible arrival of the convoy, said one US official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations.A February 26 US Department of Homeland Security bulletin to law enforcement reviewed by Reuters said trucker convoys could hinder emergency responders depending on the size of the protest.Reuters
