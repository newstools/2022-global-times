Foreign exchange Photo:XinhuaThe major reason for the change in China's foreign exchange reserves is because the dollar index has risen significantly since the beginning of this year, with the sharp fall of prices of financial assets in major countries, leading to the decrease in the amount after conversion into dollars, Wang Chunying, deputy head of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), said on Friday.Wang's remarks came after the US Department of the Treasury said on Monday that Chinese mainland's holdings of US treasury securities dropped to $980.8 billion in May, falling below $1 trillion for the first time in over 12 years.Wang noted the bond market volatility is a natural phenomenon, whether in developed or emerging economies. "For the world's largest US Treasury market, we can often see a number of reports saying that certain countries reduced their holdings of US Treasuries, so the fluctuations are normal," Wang said. In terms of the volatility in absorbing bond investment, China's volatility is much lower than that of a considerable number of developed countries and emerging economies, Wang said, adding that although the dollar strengthened further, the stability of the yuan exchange rate among major global currencies has become more prominent as the domestic economy stabilized and rebounded. As of Thursday, the dollar index had risen by more than 11 percent cumulatively so far this year, and the euro, pound and Japanese yen have depreciated between 10 percent and 17 percent against the dollar, while the yuan has depreciated by 5.8 percent to the dollar. In terms of multilateral exchange rates, the yuan exchange rate index appreciated by 0.1 percent, both indicating that the Chinese currency remained largely stable against a basket of currencies, Wang said.According to Wang, in the second half of this year, the yuan exchange rate will remain fundamentally stable due to rapid recovery of the national economy with stable supply and industrial chains, strong resilience of the national foreign trade and foreign investment development as well as the stability of the market players' exchange rate expectation.The unconventional monetary policy adjustments of the US Federal Reserve are a very important external influence for cross-border capital flows to other economies. At present, China is more confident and better equipped to effectively resolve the impact of the Fed's monetary policy adjustments on China's cross-border capital flows, Wang noted."China's comprehensive strength gets stronger and can better play the ability to absorb external shocks. With a more robust balance of payments structure, the country can better guarantee the stability and security of cross-border capital flows," Wang said.Global Times
