Beijing's average concentration of PM2.5 was 33 micrograms per cubic meter in 2021, the lowest level since records began in 2013. The capital city also saw 288 days of good air quality in 2021, up by 112 days from 2013, and only eight days of heavy air pollution, according to the environmental authority of Beijing.
