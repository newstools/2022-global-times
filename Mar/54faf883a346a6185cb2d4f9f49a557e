I'm here because I care about women having voices as well," said Campion.Campion, who was first nominated in 1994 for The Piano, earlier in the night reflected on a time when she was frequently "the only woman in the room.""I remember that outsider feeling as I fought to get my stories told, to bring dynamic stories from underserved perspectives to light in a male-dominated field."Maggie Gyllenhaal won best first-time director for The Lost Daughter, a drama about the challenges and taboos surrounding motherhood.Gyllenhaal, until now primarily known as an actress in films such as The Dark Knight and Secretary, said watching Campion's The Piano as a teen had "changed my life" and sparked a desire to one day direct."I think it is one of the real reasons that I am standing here and that ultimately, I got brave enough to say what I wanted," said Gyllenhaal.DangerousIn the last nine years, only one director, Sam Mendes, has won the top DGA award and failed to then win best director at the Oscars, a fact that propels Campion to firm favorite status for the Academy Awards on March 27. While Campion won on Saturday, many stars and nominees also devoted their speeches to fellow nominee Spielberg, with Rita Moreno hailing a "wizard," Denis Villeneuve a "giant" and Spike Lee "the godfather of cinema."Spielberg, on his 12th DGA nomination, admitted that remaking the beloved musical West Side Story had been "really scary.""It was terrifying, and I gave up a whole bunch of times. And every single time I said 'this is just too dangerous,'" the legendary director of Jaws, Schindler's List and Jurassic Park said.Lee received the DGA's lifetime achievement award, the 35th person in Hollywood history to be granted the honor, and the first black man.Attica, by Stanley Nelson, which recounts the United States' deadliest prison riot, won best documentary, beating musician Questlove's strongly favored Summer of Soul.The protest at Attica prison in 1971 New York state, by mainly Black and Latino inmates, ended in 43 deaths as law enforcement stormed the prison.'Picking a successor'Although not broadcast on television and lower key than some other Hollywood awards, the DGAs are longer-running, and its 18,000 voters including the industry's top directors offer prestigious recognition.They also honor 2022's best TV episodes, with an installment of Hacks taking best comedy and The Underground Railroad limited series.Best drama prize was a foregone conclusion, all five nominated episodes were from the same show, HBO's Succession."We're so glad that we don't have to choose the winners," said Brian Cox, who plays the patriarch of a squabbling media dynasty on Succession."Because picking any of these incredible directors is as difficult as a parent picking a successor for his business, and that is something I would never ever do," Cox said.AFP
