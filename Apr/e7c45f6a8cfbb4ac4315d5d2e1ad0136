Employees of Tianjin LNG terminal under Sinopec unload liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a ship from Nigeria on Saturday. From January to July, Sinopec's Tianjin LNG terminal unloaded 4.45 million tons of LNG, an increase of 29.8 percent year-on-year, and its import volume ranked first in the country.
