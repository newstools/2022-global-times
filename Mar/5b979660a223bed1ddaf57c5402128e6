However, many who are stuck in wait lists and in the interim have been forced to sleep in cars, caravans, tents or seek refuge at friends' homes.NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said that the government is putting "every available resource" into the recovery effort, and is currently assisting 2,000 people with accommodation placements.Xinhua
