Supporters of Indian Youth Congress shout slogans during a protest against Agnipath recruitment scheme. Agnipath is a new scheme introduced by Indian government to recruit youth into armed forces to minimize age bracket and reduce pension bills. The recruited youth into the armed force will be known as Agniveer.

I need a secure job and they have no right to offer temporary arrangements," the young man told a television news channel.Under the scheme, 46,000 cadets will be recruited in 2022 on four-year terms and 25 percent of them will be kept on ­after the four years. In a bid to end the protests, the government has adjusted parts of the plan to offer more soldiers federal and state government jobs after their service.One policy analyst said a key part of the plan was aimed at reducing government expenditure on pensions."The Agnipath scheme will reduce the life-time cost of manpower by several crore [tens of millions] rupees per head," Nitin Pai, director of the Takshashila Institution center for research on public policy, wrote in the Mint newspaper.
